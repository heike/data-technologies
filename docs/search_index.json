"],["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 What is exploratory data analysis? 2.2 What is wild data? 2.3 What is computational statistical thinking? 2.4 Workflow", " Chapter 2 Introduction We are living in an age of data - data about us, the world, and our interactions with the world and each other is being collected at an ever-increasing rate. In 2015 the estimation was that by 2020 “about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human being on the planet”. https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2015/09/30/big-data-20-mind-boggling-facts-everyone-must-read/#54f6b00a17b1 (Data Strategy, Bernard Marr) At the same time, a lot more data is being made available; political developments, such as the 2007 Open Government amendment to the Freedom of Information Act addresses data used to generate reports and requires that agencies “shall make the raw statistical data used in its reports available electronically …”. This means that data used in reports by any US Department or Agency is publicly available, and usually public in this setting means the world-wide web. Fun facts: did you know that “‘Despacito’ is awesome to listen to in any language” - in Spring and Summer 2018 it was across languages and continents the worldwide most listened to song on spotify? the number of BASHs (bird aviation strike hits) is lower in Spring when birds nest? the wingspans (finger tip to finger tip distance) of NBA players are disproportionally high compared to players’ heights and still increasing year by year? 15 year old girls score higher on boys in math, on average, in some countries, but boys always score lower than girls on reading, on average, in all countries. Those facts can be (relatively easily) found from publicly available data after a course using the material from this book. 2.1 What is exploratory data analysis? Tools of the trade described lovingly and very detailed in Tukey (1977) have moved on from paper and pencil. R (R Core Team 2018) has become the de-facto lingua franca for Statisticians and Data Analysts to communicate methods and findings. The RStudio IDE provides R users and developers infrastructure and support. To cite Julie Lowndes, NCEAS, “if R were an airplane, RStudio is the airport.” Founded by J.J. Allaire in 2009, RStudio provides an organizational framework that facilitates well-organized workflows, integration to versioning systems, and collaborations. The core of RStudio’s mission is to provide “open source and enterprise-ready professional software for the R statistical computing environment.” RStudio has been a substantial contributor to the growth of R, and has received the 2015 InfoWorld Technology of the Year Award (together with, among others, Github, Docker, and Apache Hadoop) R, RStudio and markdown, for teams: git and github … why (computational) reproducibility is crucial to any data exploration and makes our work more ethical When learning R, we are dealing with the two distinct questions of ‘how?’ and ‘why?’ almost simultaneously. The first problem is the mere mechanical problem of getting the code to the place that we want it to be. Often times this first problem is the one we think of when we state that ‘we want to learn R’. However, the second question is the ‘interesting’ one, that touches on the statistical concepts behind why we are applying some methods over others. In this book we will be trying to highlight problems from both perspectives and add the third question of “what do we learn?”. Third question completes the cycle. Tie into exploratory model. 2.2 What is wild data? “Wild data” is the data that’s ‘out there’ in the world and available to us. It’s the kind of data that we can go out and find in our quest to make sense of the world. Data is available all around us, There are many places to find data, and the types of data found at different sites can be highly varied in quality. Data, like food, can be delivered in many forms and conditions. Like sustainable high quality wild data is traceable to its source, and the source continuously updates the data, if this is appropriate. It is possible to determine the trustworthiness of the data, and the ethical usability Text book data is like highly processed food. Once upon a time it may have been fresh data, but its now been processed beyoond recognition, molded into shape that fits the tool being described. Wild data is sustainable, and will be continuously updated as new measurements arrive. Many data delivery sites, like https://data.gov.au, or even kaggle.com, should be considered to be data orphanages, the data has been dropped off and abandoned. Fresh and local wild data has meaning and relevance for the audience. What to look for in wild data Traceable source Data collection methods and processing procedures are clear and (theoretically) reproducible Updates have been made over time 2.3 What is computational statistical thinking? Statistical thinking is about understanding our world by modeling the variation we care about, and harnessing randomness to “white noise” the variation that is not of primary interest. There is definitely lots of history to statistical thinking. Florence Nightingale employed data collection, computation and data plots to improve hygiene and hence survival rates during the Crimean War. XXX more examples to relate to… Computational statistical thinking is an exciting new way of doing statistics that makes use the computational tools of today. To understand randomness, we sample, re-sample, simulate or generate values from a model. We use these to learn how the problem might look if we’d collected different data, or if particular conditions hold. It allows us to create a sandbox to play in, a virtual world to examine randomness and variation. 2.4 Workflow here References "],["accessing-data.html", "Chapter 3 Accessing Data 3.1 Flat files 3.2 Proprietary formats 3.3 Reading multiple files from a website 3.4 JSON 3.5 Shapefiles 3.6 APIs 3.7 Images as data 3.8 Databases 3.9 Working with text 3.10 Scraping Data", " Chapter 3 Accessing Data Data can be delivered in many ways, which makes it necessary to have a multitude of ways to harvest it. 3.1 Flat files Flat files, like comma or tab separated values (csv, tsv), or values specified by fixed column widths, can be accessed simply, once the format is determined. This is also a very common format is used for very large data, for example, hadoop, where the data is partitioned into many small chunks overlaid with a system to access it. 3.1.1 Example: tuberculosis The World Health Organisation (WHO) distributes data on tuberculosis case notifications through their web site at https://www.who.int/tb/country/data/download/en/. Download the latest case notifications data set, which is provided in csv format. A data dictionary is also provided explaining the format of the file, and information recorded. The data can be read into R using the code below: library(tidyverse) library(DT) tb &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;TB_notifications_2020-01-04.csv&quot;)) datatable(tb %&gt;% top_n(10)) This data has 8286 rows and 164 columns. Its not in tidy form yet, so you will see this again in the tidying material to learn how to get a messy data set wrangled. The read_csv function provides a tibble data object in R. An alternative approach to reading is with the base function read.csv which will provide a data.frame object. 3.1.2 Your turn: atmospheric carbon dioxide Atmospheric carbon dioxide recordings are delivered by the Scripps CO\\(_2\\) program, and available at https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/sampling_stations.html. Choose a station and download or directly read the csv file. You will need to skip over a number of lines at the top of the file in order to read only the data. 3.1.3 Example: standardised test scores for reading, science and math Every three years the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment measures the ability of 15 year old students across the globe in reading, science and mathematics skills. This data is made available at https://www.oecd.org/pisa/. The format that the data is distributed in, is different from survey to survey, with the earliest years being text files, and later years in proprietary formats. The text files have fixed width format, where each variable occupies a fixed set of columns in the text. Let’s take a look at the 2006 student data. Download the file from the OECD web site – you should find that it is named INT_Stu06_Dec07.txt, or work with the subset of the first 2000 rows that is provided here. # This is a previously generated data object of the column widths of variables load(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;PISA_student_2006_varwidths.rda&quot;)) # To work with the full data set, use the downloaded file, INT_Sch06_Dec07.zip # instead of INT_Stu06_Dec07_25k.txt d &lt;- read_fwf(file=here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;INT_Stu06_Dec07_2k.txt&quot;), col_positions=fwf_widths(var_widths$widths, col_names=var_widths$names)) datatable(d %&gt;% top_n(10)) Thelearningtower package available at https://github.com/ropenscilabs/learningtower contains the data for multiple years and code to process the source files. 3.1.4 Your turn: land surface weather station data The Global Historical Climate Network delivers data from land surface stations across the globe. Records for individual stations are provided using a fixed width format flat file. Find a station near you, and download the file. The list of stations can be found here. Your station file is identified by the station id. For example, the Melbourne airport station ID is ASN00086282, and thus the data file can be downloaded directly from ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/all/ASN00086282.dly. Documentation on the file format and how to cite the archive is available at https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt. The column widths of the variables can be determined from this information. Work out the column widths for each variable Write the code to read in this fixed width format The data is far from tidy, and needs considerable work to get it into a suitable format for analysis. A more friendly and tider csv formatted data have been made available recently which can be acessed through the https server on the same location. 3.2 Proprietary formats Data is often delivered in a specialist formats developed by a company, or individual, that has a special encoding scheme. Examples include excel files, SAS or SPSS files. These require decoding in order to read. 3.2.1 Example: Australia air traffic data The Australian Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development provides excel format files summarising air traffic at airports. Download the most recent data, and open the excel file. There are multiple sheets. The third sheet has passenger numbers. There are 6 rows of meta-information, which need to be ignored when reading the data. library(readxl) passengers &lt;- read_xlsx(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;WebAirport_FY_1986-2019.xlsx&quot;), sheet=3, skip=6) datatable(passengers) 3.2.2 Your turn: Munging spreadsheets The book Spreaadsheet Munging Strategies by Duncan Garmonsway is a really good source of dealing with complicated excel spreadsheets. We recommend working through examples in this book to familiarise ways to deal with messy spreadsheets, and incorporating information such as special formatting into the data. The case study developed from Bob Rudis’s post on CDC vaccination data is especially recommended. 3.2.3 Example: SPSS binary The 2015 and 2018 PISA surveys are available in bniary file format, which is a more complete data format in the sense of variable typing and level descriptions integrated with the data. The R package haven can be used to read foreign binary formats. Download the 2018 data from https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2018database/ (494Mb), and use the following code to read it into R. There is a data dictionary on the same site which describes fields in detail. This is really useful for deciding which variables to keep. library(haven) stu_qqq &lt;- read_sav(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;SPSS_STU_QQQ.zip&quot;)) PISA_au_2018 &lt;- stu_qqq %&gt;% filter(CNT == &quot;AUS&quot;) %&gt;% select(CNT, ST004D01T, ST012Q01TA, ST013Q01TA, PV1MATH:PV10SCIE) # Keep country, gender, num TVs, num books, saveRDS(PISA_au_2018, file=here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;PISA_au_2018.rds&quot;)) 3.3 Reading multiple files from a website Often multiple datasets are available in a web site. It is tedious, and inefficient to manually download each file and read into R. An example is data on the rental market in Tasmania from data.gov.au. The sawfish package makes it easier to download multiple files automatically. The package is only available on GitHub, and needs too be installed using the devtools package. Here is sample code to read all of the xlsx files on Tasmania’s rental market. library(readxl) # devtools::install_github(&quot;AnthonyEbert/sawfish&quot;) library(sawfish) url&lt;-&quot;http://data.gov.au/data/dataset/rental-bond-and-rental-data-tasmania-2016-to-2017&quot; fls &lt;- find_files(url, &quot;xlsx&quot;) # Check that one file can be read nicely f1 &lt;- tempfile() download.file(fls[1], f1, mode=&quot;wb&quot;) t1 &lt;- read_xlsx(path=f1, sheet=1) # Now read all files rentals &lt;- NULL for (i in 1:length(fls)) { download.file(fls[i], f1, mode=&quot;wb&quot;) t1 &lt;- read_xlsx(path=f1, sheet=1) rentals &lt;- bind_rows(rentals, t1) } datatable(t1 %&gt;% top_n(10)) 3.4 JSON With the advent of web communication, comes JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). It is a language-independent data format, and supplants extensible markup language (XML). It is a verbose data descriptor. Here’s an example from wikipedia describing a person: { &quot;firstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;lastName&quot;: &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;isAlive&quot;: true, &quot;age&quot;: 25, &quot;address&quot;: { &quot;streetAddress&quot;: &quot;21 2nd Street&quot;, &quot;city&quot;: &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;state&quot;: &quot;NY&quot;, &quot;postalCode&quot;: &quot;10021-3100&quot; }, &quot;phoneNumbers&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;home&quot;, &quot;number&quot;: &quot;212 555-1234&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;office&quot;, &quot;number&quot;: &quot;646 555-4567&quot; }, { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;mobile&quot;, &quot;number&quot;: &quot;123 456-7890&quot; } ], &quot;children&quot;: [], &quot;spouse&quot;: null } 3.4.1 Example: Crossrates An example we have seen is the cross rates data available at https://openexchangerates.org/. To access this data you need to: Get a free plan from https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free Tell this function your API key – Sys.setenv(\"OER_KEY\" = \"your-key-here\") This code can be used to get the latest 10 days of crossrates. library(lubridate) library(jsonlite) library(glue) # Function to read in rate for one day, given dates and an API key getDay &lt;- function(day, key) { u &lt;- sprintf( &quot;https://openexchangerates.org/api/historical/%s.json?app_id=%s&quot;, day, key ) d &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(u) # convert timestamp to date object # http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13456241/convert-unix-epoch-to-date-object-in-r rates &lt;- as.data.frame(d$rates) rates$date &lt;- as.POSIXct(res$timestamp, origin = &quot;1970-01-01&quot;) data.frame(rates) } # Read in a set of dates using purrr rates10 &lt;- days %&gt;% purrr::map_dfr(~getDay(day = ., key=&quot;your-API-key&quot;)) saveRDS(rates10, file=here::here(&quot;data&quot;,&quot;rates.rds&quot;)) 3.5 Shapefiles The basic building block of a map is a set of points and an ordering variable which can be used to connect the dots with lines, so that a geographic region can be interpreted. Maps are important because they summarise our physical world, and provide the context for data collected for many different purposes – political, health, environment, commerce. Map information is often recorded and shared in specialised formats, all of which efficiently keep the structural aspects of spatial data organised. The sf (FIXME:REF) package provides tools to access this data. Here is an example related to bush fires in Australia. In Victoria, there are five Country Fire Authority (CFA) regions. These are organisational regions for fire management. The shapefiles associated with these regions can be downloaded from http://services.land.vic.gov.au/SpatialDatamart/, but these are also provided with this repo. The format is a folder of several binary files, which collectively describe the map geometry. A good explanation of shapefiles can be found here. library(sf) library(tidyverse) boundaries &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/vic_cfa/cfa_region.shp&quot;) Reading layer `cfa_region&#39; from data source `/Users/cookd/data-technologies/data/vic_cfa/cfa_region.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; Simple feature collection with 5 features and 3 fields Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON Dimension: XY Bounding box: xmin: 140.9619 ymin: -39.13658 xmax: 149.9763 ymax: -33.98135 Geodetic CRS: GDA94 Shapefiles are typically very detailed, and big in size. For data analysis, these are usually too detailed. Its a good idea to reduce the size, by removing some of the boundary points. This is a tricky task, because some boundary points are more important for defining the boundary than others, and they need to be kept. The rmapshaper package has a thinning function that works nicely to create a small and relatively map accurate shapefile. Note that, the geom_sf function from the sf package can be used to directly plot the shapefile. An alternative, albeit a lot more work, is to convert the object into a tibble of points, group ids, and and ordering variable and plot using the geom_polygon. library(rmapshaper) bound_sm &lt;- ms_simplify(boundaries, keep_shapes = TRUE) ggplot(data=bound_sm) + geom_sf(aes(fill=CFA_REGION)) Shapefiles can also be used to contain point information, for example the locations of fire stations. Locations of fire stations in Victoria can be downloaded from the same Victorian Government site, and overlaid on the polygon data. fire_stations &lt;- st_read(&quot;data/vic_fire_stations/geomark_point.shp&quot;) %&gt;% filter(FEATSUBTYP ==&quot;fire station&quot;, STATE==&quot;VIC&quot;) Reading layer `geomark_point&#39; from data source `/Users/cookd/data-technologies/data/vic_fire_stations/geomark_point.shp&#39; using driver `ESRI Shapefile&#39; Simple feature collection with 52658 features and 23 fields Geometry type: MULTIPOINT Dimension: XY Bounding box: xmin: 140.502 ymin: -39.13655 xmax: 150.0495 ymax: -33.01086 Geodetic CRS: GDA94 ggplot(data=bound_sm) + geom_sf() + geom_sf(data=fire_stations, colour=&quot;red&quot;, shape=3) 3.6 APIs 3.6.1 Melbourne pedestrian traffic: rwalkr 3.6.2 Australian weather: bomrang 3.6.3 Atlas of Living Austraila: ala4R 3.7 Images as data An example is http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/ ETC3250 assignments from Di - simplify, maybe not full set of Bob Ross paintings maybe Susan’s shoeprint? 3.8 Databases 3.9 Working with text 3.10 Scraping Data There are a lot of different packages available in R that allow us to scrape data. Remember that APIs and data services provide a service to us. Always scrape responsibly and don’t violate Terms of Service! 3.10.1 Examples 3.10.1.1 Weather in Ames Problem What does today’s temperature tell us about tomorrow’s? This question is inspired by Rob Hyndman’s answer to it for temperatures in Melbourne as detailed in (Hyndman 1996) and (Rob J. Hyndman 1996). Data source The website Weather Underground https://www.wunderground.com/ provides current and historic weather information for weather stations all across the globe. For historic data, each day is summarised by a set of statistics, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speeds and compared to averages. The process We want to scrape the daily information from Weather Underground for a particular station and some time frame. First, we write a scraper: # functions getWeather &lt;- function(station = &quot;KAMW&quot;, year = 2015, month = 1, day = 1) { numbers &lt;- &quot;[-]*[0-9\\\\.]*[e0-9]*&quot; units &lt;- &quot;[°a-zA-Z ]+&quot; require(stringr) require(rvest) url &lt;- sprintf( &quot;https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/%s/%s/%s/%s/DailyHistory.html&quot;, station, year, month, day ) html &lt;- read_html(url) tabs &lt;- html %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;table&quot;) day.stats &lt;- html_table(tabs[[1]], fill = TRUE) if (is.null(day.stats$Actual)) return(NULL) # no data available day.stats$Unit &lt;- str_extract(day.stats$Actual, pattern = units) day.stats$Actual &lt;- as.numeric(str_extract(day.stats$Actual, pattern = numbers)) day.stats$Average &lt;- as.numeric(str_extract(day.stats$Average, pattern = numbers)) day.stats$RecordYear &lt;- str_extract(day.stats$Record, pattern = &quot;\\\\([0-9]{4}\\\\)&quot;) day.stats$RecordYear &lt;- gsub(&quot;[\\\\(\\\\)]&quot;,&quot;&quot;, day.stats$RecordYear) day.stats$Record &lt;- as.numeric(str_extract(day.stats$Record, pattern = numbers)) day.stats$Station &lt;- station day.stats$Date &lt;- sprintf(&quot;%s/%s/%s&quot;,year,month,day) names(day.stats)[1] &lt;- &quot;Statistics&quot; day.stats } And now we scrape: ###################### library(lubridate) # download data for last &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2016-03-01&quot;) first &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2008-02-21&quot;) days &lt;- seq(first, last, &quot;day&quot;) filename &lt;- &quot;data/KAMW.csv&quot; station &lt;- &quot;KAMW&quot; for (dateIDX in length(days):1) { # browser() date &lt;- days[dateIDX] res &lt;- getWeather(station, year(date), month(date), mday(date)) write.table(res, file=filename, append=file.exists(filename), col.names=!file.exists(filename), row.names=F, sep=&quot;,&quot;) } And now it’s time for the analysis. Create a vector of the previous days temperatures and plot in a scatterplot. Alternatively, a two-dimensional histogram (using hex binning) also works well in this example, because the focus here is on the high density areas: weather &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/KAMW.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) weather$Actual &lt;- as.numeric(weather$Actual) weather$Average &lt;- as.numeric(weather$Average) weather$Record &lt;- as.numeric(weather$Record) temps &lt;- subset(weather, Statistics==&quot;Max Temperature&quot;) temps$Previous &lt;- c(temps$Actual[-1], NA) library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = temps, aes(x = Previous, y = Actual)) + geom_jitter(alpha = I(0.5)) + geom_smooth() + xlab(&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + coord_equal() ggplot(data = temps, aes(x = Previous, y = Actual)) + geom_hex() + xlab(&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + coord_equal() What we see is a strong linear pattern, i.e. tomorrow’s maximum temperature is close to what we see today, making it a very strong predictor. There is a peak in density at temperatures around 30 degree Celsius (shown in the binned scatterplot by the light blue tiles). With higher temperatures we see less variability, while at lower temperatures this relationship is more variable. 3.10.1.2 Your turn The pattern discussed involves maximum temperatures. How would you expect this pattern to change for averages? Explain your expectation first, then check. Reformat the weather data set in such a way that you can easily compare Maximum and minimum temperatures in a scatterplot. How do temperatures behave over the course of a year? Organize the data correspondingly and plot. How does the temperature pattern compare to another place in the world, say e.g. Melbourne, Australia? Solution for last question Scrape the data last &lt;- as.Date(&quot;2016-03-01&quot;) first &lt;- as.Date(&quot;1995-01-01&quot;) last &lt;- days[dateIDX] first &lt;- as.Date(&quot;1995-01-01&quot;) days &lt;- seq(first, last, &quot;day&quot;) filename &lt;- &quot;data/YMML.csv&quot; station &lt;- &quot;YMML&quot; for (dateIDX in length(days):1) { # browser() date &lt;- days[dateIDX] res &lt;- getWeather(station, year(date), month(date), mday(date)) write.table(res, file=filename, append=file.exists(filename), col.names=!file.exists(filename), row.names=F, sep=&quot;,&quot;) } and plot the data: #weather &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/YMML.csv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) weather &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/YMML.csv&quot;) temps &lt;- subset(weather, Statistics==&quot;Max Temperature&quot;) temps$Previous &lt;- c(temps$Actual[-1], NA) ggplot(data=temps) + geom_hex(aes(x=Previous, y=Actual)) + #, fill=log(..value..))) + xlab(&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + coord_equal() In the paper by (Rob J. Hyndman 1996) conditional densities are used: given today’s temperature what is the density distribution for tomorrow’s temperatures? We can use high-density region (HDR) boxplots to show the results. The location of the dot indicates the location of the density’s highest mode. # bin yesterday&#39;s temperatures and compute densities of today&#39;s temperatures for each level library(lubridate) #temps$Month &lt;- month(temps$Date) #subtemps &lt;- subset(temps, Month %in% c(12,1,2)) subtemps &lt;- na.omit(temps[,c(&quot;Previous&quot;, &quot;Actual&quot;)]) library(hdrcde) temps.cde &lt;- with(subtemps, cde(Previous, Actual, nxmargin=40)) plot(temps.cde,xlab=&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;,ylab=&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;,plot.fn=&quot;hdr&quot;, prob=c(50, 95)) 3.10.1.3 Weather in Ames (API Version) In many cases, you are not the first person attempting to use an online dataset for some sort of analysis. Some sites maintain an API (Application Programming Interface) which allows data access via simplified commands. In situations where an API is available (and free), it is generally better to utilize the API than to write a custom scraping function, as typically APIs are more stable than web page structure over time. In some cases, there are even simplified interfaces to the site’s API: for weather data, the rnoaa package provides R bindings to several APIs maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. if (!&quot;rnoaa&quot; %in% installed.packages()) { install.packages(&quot;rnoaa&quot;) } library(rnoaa) First, we use the meteo_nearby_stations function to identify weather stations near Ames, IA: lat_lon_df &lt;- data.frame(id = &quot;ames&quot;, latitude = 42.034722, longitude = -93.62) # Get weather station closest to Ames # Not all stations have all variables, so make sure TMAX is included nearby_stations &lt;- meteo_nearby_stations( lat_lon_df = lat_lon_df, radius = 10, limit = 3, var = &quot;TMAX&quot;) The meteo_pull_monitors function pulls data from the specified variables for the specified date range, for each station id provided. ## library(dplyr) # According to https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt, # data are provided in tenths of a degree Celsius max_temperature &lt;- meteo_pull_monitors( nearby_stations$ames$id, var = &quot;TMAX&quot;, date_min = &quot;2008-01-01&quot;, date_max = format.Date(Sys.Date(), &quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)) %&gt;% mutate(tmax = tmax/10) # Convert to whole degrees Celsius Formatting this data for plotting is relatively straightforward: max_temperature &lt;- max_temperature %&gt;% mutate(yday_tmax = lag(tmax, 1)) library(ggplot2) ggplot(data = max_temperature, aes(x = yday_tmax, y = tmax)) + geom_jitter(alpha = I(0.5)) + geom_smooth() + xlab(&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + coord_equal() ggplot(data = max_temperature, aes(x = yday_tmax, y = tmax)) + geom_hex() + xlab(&quot;Yesterday&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Today&#39;s maximum temperature&quot;) + coord_equal() Using the API makes for much simpler code! 3.10.1.4 Your turn Use the API to get minimum and average daily temperatures in addition to maximum temperatures. Reformat the weather data set in such a way that you can easily compare maximum and minimum temperatures in a scatterplot. How do temperatures behave over the course of a year? Organize the data correspondingly and plot.

An observation is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. I’ll sometimes refer to an observation as a data point. For the grad programs, this is institution, and program, uniquley define the observation. A value is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable typically changes from observation to observation. 4.2 Tidy tabular form Tabular data is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is tidy if each value is placed in its own cell, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row. 4.2.1 Wide format The grad programs data in tabular form. It also is in wide tidy form, because there are multiple columns containing different variables. library(emo) library(tidyverse) grad &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/graduate-programs.csv&quot;) grad %&gt;% top_n(10) # A tibble: 10 × 16 subject Inst AvNumPubs AvNumCits PctFacGrants PctCompletion &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 economics BOSTON UNIVERSITY 0.49 2.66 36.9 34.2 2 economics UNIVERSITY OF CALI… 0.79 2.68 71.4 42.6 3 economics UNIVERSITY OF CHIC… 0.61 3.44 54.8 62.5 4 economics UNIVERSITY OF MARY… 0.61 1.81 50.4 37.9 5 psychology NORTHERN ILLINOIS … 0.92 1.32 45.8 32.1 6 psychology UNIVERSITY OF CALI… 1.42 4.45 72 48.9 7 psychology UNIVERSITY OF CONN… 1.15 3.47 69.5 46.8 8 psychology UNIVERSITY OF FLOR… 1.05 1.72 65.6 34.2 9 psychology UNIVERSITY OF ILLI… 1.39 3.3 57.2 28.1 10 psychology UNIVERSITY OF MINN… 2.02 2.89 69.9 39 # ℹ 10 more variables: MedianTimetoDegree &lt;dbl&gt;, PctMinorityFac &lt;dbl&gt;, # PctFemaleFac &lt;dbl&gt;, PctFemaleStud &lt;dbl&gt;, PctIntlStud &lt;dbl&gt;, # AvNumPhDs &lt;dbl&gt;, AvGREs &lt;dbl&gt;, TotFac &lt;dbl&gt;, PctAsstProf &lt;dbl&gt;, # NumStud &lt;dbl&gt; What’s good about the format?

There are many different access points for data, but primarily aggregated data is the main type available. Examples at accessing the Census data from the ABS can be found in the eechidna package. The individual csv files must be held locally. They come from a zip file and can be downloaded from: https://datapacks.censusdata.abs.gov.au/datapacks/ Select: 2016 Census Datapacks, General Community Profile, Commonwealth Electoral Divisons Download for all of Australia Unzip the package - its necessary, because the data is delivered in many small csv files. There is also the license information detailing appropriate usage, and detailed information about the formats.

You can make unique solutions, but then another data set comes along, and you have to again make a unique solution. Tidy data can be though of as legos. Once you have this form, you can put it together in so many different ways, to make different analyses and visualizations. 4.6 Tidy verbs gather: specify the keys (identifiers) and the values (measures) to make long form (used to be called melting) spread: move a variable from a row into columns (used to be called casting) separate: split a character vector into columns 4.7 Tidying genes data genes # A tibble: 3 × 12 id `WI-6.R1` `WI-6.R2` `WI-6.R4` `WM-6.R1` `WM-6.R2` `WI-12.R1` `WI-12.R2` &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Gene 1 2.18 2.20 4.20 2.63 5.06 4.54 5.53 2 Gene 2 1.46 0.585 1.86 0.515 2.88 1.36 2.96 3 Gene 3 2.03 0.870 3.28 0.533 4.63 2.18 5.56 # ℹ 4 more variables: `WI-12.R4` &lt;dbl&gt;, `WM-12.R1` &lt;dbl&gt;, `WM-12.R2` &lt;dbl&gt;, # `WM-12.R4` &lt;dbl&gt; genes_long &lt;- genes %&gt;% gather(variable, expr, -id) genes_long # A tibble: 33 × 3 id variable expr &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Gene 1 WI-6.R1 2.18 2 Gene 2 WI-6.R1 1.46 3 Gene 3 WI-6.R1 2.03 4 Gene 1 WI-6.R2 2.20 5 Gene 2 WI-6.R2 0.585 6 Gene 3 WI-6.R2 0.870 7 Gene 1 WI-6.R4 4.20 8 Gene 2 WI-6.R4 1.86 9 Gene 3 WI-6.R4 3.28 10 Gene 1 WM-6.R1 2.63 # ℹ 23 more rows In this example, we identified the columns as containing expression levels of a gene during different experimental conditions (variables). We have gathered these variables into a single column, with the expression levels in a corresponding column. The -id argument to gather() indicates that we do not want the id column to be gathered; this has the effect of repeating the 3 values of gene for each variable. 4.7.1 Separate columns The variables in the previous example are a cryptic combination of treatment, timepoint, and replicate. Using separate(), we can separate this information out into a tidy (and much more human friendly) representation of the experimental conditions: genes_long %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;trt&quot;, &quot;leftover&quot;), &quot;-&quot;) # A tibble: 33 × 4 id trt leftover expr &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Gene 1 WI 6.R1 2.18 2 Gene 2 WI 6.R1 1.46 3 Gene 3 WI 6.R1 2.03 4 Gene 1 WI 6.R2 2.20 5 Gene 2 WI 6.R2 0.585 6 Gene 3 WI 6.R2 0.870 7 Gene 1 WI 6.R4 4.20 8 Gene 2 WI 6.R4 1.86 9 Gene 3 WI 6.R4 3.28 10 Gene 1 WM 6.R1 2.63 # ℹ 23 more rows First, we separate the treatment from the rest of the information. Next, we separate the remainder into timepoint and replicate variables. genes_long %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;trt&quot;, &quot;leftover&quot;), &quot;-&quot;) %&gt;% separate(leftover, c(&quot;time&quot;, &quot;rep&quot;), &quot;\\\\.&quot;) # A tibble: 33 × 5 id trt time rep expr &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 Gene 1 WI 6 R1 2.18 2 Gene 2 WI 6 R1 1.46 3 Gene 3 WI 6 R1 2.03 4 Gene 1 WI 6 R2 2.20 5 Gene 2 WI 6 R2 0.585 6 Gene 3 WI 6 R2 0.870 7 Gene 1 WI 6 R4 4.20 8 Gene 2 WI 6 R4 1.86 9 Gene 3 WI 6 R4 3.28 10 Gene 1 WM 6 R1 2.63 # ℹ 23 more rows This data is tidy, in that observations are in rows and variables are in columns, but it is not as easy to read. We can examine the different features of this data set using spread(). 4.7.2 Now spread to examine different aspects There are several different features of the data which we might want to explore. Each feature requires a slight reconfiguration of the dataset, but these are easily accomplished using spread(). 4.7.2.1 Examine treatments against each other genes_long &lt;- genes_long %&gt;% separate(variable, c(&quot;trt&quot;, &quot;leftover&quot;), &quot;-&quot;) %&gt;% separate(leftover, c(&quot;time&quot;, &quot;rep&quot;), &quot;\\\\.&quot;) genes_long %&gt;% spread(trt, expr) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=WI, y=WM, colour=id, shape = id)) + geom_point() Generally, some negative association within each gene, WM is low if WI is high. 4.7.2.2 Examine replicates against each other genes_long %&gt;% spread(rep, expr) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=R1, y=R4, colour=id)) + geom_point() + coord_equal() Very roughly, replicate 4 is like replicate 1, eg if one is low, the other is low.

Its actually a suite of packages, and you can learn more about the individual packages at https://www.tidyverse.org. You could load each individually. Because so many people contribute packages to R, it is a blessing and a curse. The best techniques are available, but there can be conflicts between function names. When you load tidyverse it prints a great summary of conflicts that it knows about, between its functions and others. library(tidyverse) For example, there is a filter function in the stats package that comes with the R distribution. This can cause confusion when you want to use the filter function in dplyr (part of tidyverse). To be sure the function you use is the one you want to use, you can prefix it with the package name, dplyr::filter(). 5.3 Example: french fries Load the data Gather into long form load(&quot;data/french_fries.rda&quot;) ff_long &lt;- french_fries %&gt;% gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep) %&gt;% mutate(type=as.factor(type)) 5.3.1 The story of the french fries data…. This was an actual experiment in Food Sciences at Iowa State University. The goal was to find out if some cheaper oil options could be used to make hot chips: that people would not be able to distinguish the difference between chips fried in the new oils relative to those fried in the current market leader. Twelve tasters were recruited to sample two chips from each batch, over a period of ten weeks. The same oil was kept for a period of 10 weeks! May be a bit gross by the end! This data set was brought to R by Hadley Wickham, and was one of the problems that inspired the thinking about tidy data and the plyr tools. 5.4 filter: choose observations Filter records for subject 10. ff_long_subj10 &lt;- ff_long %&gt;% filter(subject == 10) ff_long_subj10 # A tibble: 300 × 6 time treatment subject rep type rating &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1 1 10 1 potato 11 2 1 1 10 2 potato 9.9 3 1 2 10 1 potato 9.3 4 1 2 10 2 potato 11 5 1 3 10 1 potato 11.3 6 1 3 10 2 potato 10.1 7 2 1 10 1 potato 8 8 2 1 10 2 potato 10.2 9 2 2 10 1 potato 11.2 10 2 2 10 2 potato 8.2 # ℹ 290 more rows == does a logical equals check. This works nicely for characters or factors but not for numerical data. To filter you need to do some comparison to find the subset of observations you are interested in.

The data is downloaded from http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/. The SPSS format “Student questionnaire data file (419MB)” is downloaded and processed using this code, to extract results for Australia: library(haven) pisa_2015 &lt;- read_sav(file.choose()) pisa_au &lt;- pisa_2015 %&gt;% filter(CNT == &quot;AUS&quot;) save(pisa_au, file=&quot;pisa_au.rda&quot;) You don’t need to do this, because the Australia data is extracted and saved for you. Your task is to answer these questions about Australia. At times it may be helpful to examine the data dictionary, which is provided as an excel file (you can also download this directly from the OECD PISA site too).

Compute the average of math scores by state. Which state does best, on average, on math? (You should use the stuweight variable to compute a weighted average. This is survey data, and the weights indicate how representative that individual is of the population.) Compute the difference in average male and female math scores by state. Which state has the smallest average gender difference? Does test anxiety have an effect math score? (Use the variable anxtest, and a simple regression model to answer this question.) Explain what the rename operation is doing. Come up with two more questions as a group, based on the data description. Do the wrangling to answer these questions. Discuss these with a tutor. 5.12 Relational data, and joins It’s rare that a data analysis involves only a single table of data. Typically you have many tables of data, and you must combine them to answer the questions that you’re interested in. Collectively, multiple tables of data are called relational data because it is the relations, not just the individual datasets, that are important. library(tidyverse) library(nycflights13) The nycflights13 is a small example data set, flights that departed NYC in 2013, taken from a public database of all commercial airline flights in the USA, https://www.transtats.bts.gov.

There is always a decision on what observations are copied to the new table as well. 5.12.2.1 Types of joins Inner join: intersection between the two tables, only the observations that are in both Outer (full) join: union of the two tables, all observations from both, and missing values might get added Left join: All observations from the “left” table, but only the observations from the “right” table that match those in the left. Right join: Same as left in reverse.

Make a map that shows the origin to destinations made by Delta flights, from La Guardia airport, for the month of August. You will need to Filter the flights data to contain just Delta flights, for August Add the airport locations (lat, long) of the origin and destination to the flights data Pull a google map, and plot it Draw lines connecting origin to destination airports on the map Does wind direction, when windspeed is stronger, affect the operations at the airport? Generally cross winds affect airport operations. If the wind is reasonably strong and blowing across the runway, there are likely to be more delays. It could be helpful if you can find maps of the three airports in NYC to check how many runways they have, and the orientation of them. You will need to Join the weather data to the flights data Filter by airport and higher wind speeds Plot delay against wind direction, perhaps focusing a restricted range of delay or using only a smoother instead of all the points "],["handling-missings.html", "Chapter 6 Handling Missings 6.1 Overview 6.2 A story of missing flights 6.3 Data set overview 6.4 Missing value patterns 6.5 Shadow matrix 6.6 Strategy 6.7 Common ways to impute values 6.8 Exercise", " Chapter 6 Handling Missings 6.1 Overview The story of missing flights Data set overviews Missingness patterns Common ways to impute Checking imputed values 6.2 A story of missing flights Do you know what a ghost flight is? When we were were first analysing the US airline traffic data, we found that it quite often occurred that a plane (identified by its tail number) landed at one airport but took off from another airport, e.g. Year Month DayofMonth DepTime ArrTime Origin Dest Diverted 1995 3 8 1102 1256 PIT CVG 0 1995 3 8 1311 NA CVG PIT 1 1995 3 8 1913 2050 RIC PIT 0 1995 3 8 2134 2300 PIT MSY 0 The plane landed in Pittsburgh but took off in Richmond. This happens when a plane is needed at a location where there’s a shortage. A plane flies empty and it doesn’t get listed in the database. When it happens a lot, it indicates that the company is operating inefficiently. An example was AirTran in March 2003. 46 flights, for a total of 31510 miles. Airtran repeatedly had financial difficulties in the following years, and finally ceased operations in 2014. Missing values are not always obvious in data. 6.3 Data set overview library(tidyverse) library(visdat) library(naniar) tb &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/TB_notifications_2018-03-18.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(country, iso3, year, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% gather(stuff, count, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% separate(stuff, c(&quot;stuff1&quot;, &quot;stuff2&quot;, &quot;genderage&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-stuff1, -stuff2) %&gt;% mutate(gender=substr(genderage, 1, 1), age=substr(genderage, 2, length(genderage))) %&gt;% select(-genderage) tb_au &lt;- tb %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Australia&quot;) vis_dat(tb_au) Overview of the tb incidence in Australia. This type of display is called a “heatmap”, displays the data table, with cells coloured according to some other information. In this case it is type of variable, and missingness status. What do we learn? Most of the variables are character (text) variables, or integer variables. Missing values are located only in the counts, but it is in blocks, so perhaps corresponds to some category levels of the other variables. 6.4 Missing value patterns West Pacific Tropical Atmosphere Ocean Data, 1993 &amp; 1997, for improved detection, understanding and prediction of El Nino and La Nina, collected from http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/tao/index.shtml glimpse(oceanbuoys) Rows: 736 Columns: 8 $ year &lt;dbl&gt; 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997,… $ latitude &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… $ longitude &lt;dbl&gt; -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110,… $ sea_temp_c &lt;dbl&gt; 27.59, 27.55, 27.57, 27.62, 27.65, 27.83, 28.01, 28.04, 28.… $ air_temp_c &lt;dbl&gt; 27.15, 27.02, 27.00, 26.93, 26.84, 26.94, 27.04, 27.11, 27.… $ humidity &lt;dbl&gt; 79.6, 75.8, 76.5, 76.2, 76.4, 76.7, 76.5, 78.3, 78.6, 76.9,… $ wind_ew &lt;dbl&gt; -6.4, -5.3, -5.1, -4.9, -3.5, -4.4, -2.0, -3.7, -4.2, -3.6,… $ wind_ns &lt;dbl&gt; 5.4, 5.3, 4.5, 2.5, 4.1, 1.6, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.9, 1.8,… The data has 736 observations, and 8 variables. All of the variables are numeric (including year). 6.4.1 Missingness map vis_miss(oceanbuoys, sort_miss=TRUE) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) What do we learn? Two variables, air temperature and humidity, have a large number of missings. Year, latitude and longitude have no missings Sea temperature has a couple of missings Some rows have a lot of missings Overall statistics, 3% of possible values are missing. That’s not much. BUT, both air temperature and humidity have more than 10% missing which is too much to ignore. 6.4.2 Numerical summaries Proportion of observations missing: s_miss &lt;- miss_summary(oceanbuoys) s_miss$miss_df_prop [1] 0.03006114 Proportion of variables missing: s_miss$miss_var_prop [1] 0.375 How many observations have \\(k\\) missings? s_miss$miss_case_table [[1]] # A tibble: 4 × 3 n_miss_in_case n_cases pct_cases &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0 565 76.8 2 1 167 22.7 3 2 2 0.272 4 3 2 0.272 By group s_miss_group &lt;- oceanbuoys %&gt;% group_by(year) %&gt;% miss_summary() s_miss_group$miss_case_table [[1]] # A tibble: 6 × 4 # Groups: year [2] year n_miss_in_case n_cases pct_cases &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1997 0 291 79.1 2 1997 1 77 20.9 3 1993 0 274 74.5 4 1993 1 90 24.5 5 1993 2 2 0.543 6 1993 3 2 0.543 You can call these separately with: prop_miss - The proportion of missings miss_var_prop - The proportion of variables with a missing miss_case_table - The proportion of cases with \\(k\\) missings 6.4.3 Tend to get ignored by most software and this is a problem, because results computed on data with missing values might be biased. for example, ggplot ignores them, but at least tells you its ignoring them: ggplot(oceanbuoys, aes(x = sea_temp_c, y = humidity)) + geom_point() + theme(aspect.ratio=1) Warning: Removed 94 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`). 6.4.4 Add them to plot ggplot(oceanbuoys, aes(x = sea_temp_c, y = humidity)) + scale_colour_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + geom_miss_point() + theme(aspect.ratio=1) By year ggplot(oceanbuoys, aes(x = sea_temp_c, y = humidity)) + geom_miss_point() + scale_colour_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + facet_wrap(~year) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) 6.4.5 Understanding missing dependencies ggplot(oceanbuoys, aes(x = sea_temp_c, y = air_temp_c)) + geom_miss_point() + scale_colour_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + facet_wrap(~year) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) What do we learn? There is a different missingness pattern in each of the years Year needs to be accounted for in finding good substitute values. 6.5 Shadow matrix The shadow table is created to mark the location of missings in the original data table. Here, this gets appended to the original data, and then can be used to submet, or colour by different types of missingness. as_shadow(oceanbuoys) # A tibble: 736 × 8 year_NA latitude_NA longitude_NA sea_temp_c_NA air_temp_c_NA humidity_NA &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; 1 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 2 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 3 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 4 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 5 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 6 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 7 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 8 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 9 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA 10 !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA !NA # ℹ 726 more rows # ℹ 2 more variables: wind_ew_NA &lt;fct&gt;, wind_ns_NA &lt;fct&gt; tao_shadow &lt;- bind_shadow(oceanbuoys) tao_shadow # A tibble: 736 × 16 year latitude longitude sea_temp_c air_temp_c humidity wind_ew wind_ns &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 1997 0 -110 27.6 27.1 79.6 -6.40 5.40 2 1997 0 -110 27.5 27.0 75.8 -5.30 5.30 3 1997 0 -110 27.6 27 76.5 -5.10 4.5 4 1997 0 -110 27.6 26.9 76.2 -4.90 2.5 5 1997 0 -110 27.6 26.8 76.4 -3.5 4.10 6 1997 0 -110 27.8 26.9 76.7 -4.40 1.60 7 1997 0 -110 28.0 27.0 76.5 -2 3.5 8 1997 0 -110 28.0 27.1 78.3 -3.70 4.5 9 1997 0 -110 28.0 27.2 78.6 -4.20 5 10 1997 0 -110 28.0 27.2 76.9 -3.60 3.5 # ℹ 726 more rows # ℹ 8 more variables: year_NA &lt;fct&gt;, latitude_NA &lt;fct&gt;, longitude_NA &lt;fct&gt;, # sea_temp_c_NA &lt;fct&gt;, air_temp_c_NA &lt;fct&gt;, humidity_NA &lt;fct&gt;, # wind_ew_NA &lt;fct&gt;, wind_ns_NA &lt;fct&gt; glimpse(tao_shadow) Rows: 736 Columns: 16 $ year &lt;dbl&gt; 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 1997, 19… $ latitude &lt;dbl&gt; 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,… $ longitude &lt;dbl&gt; -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -110, -1… $ sea_temp_c &lt;dbl&gt; 27.59, 27.55, 27.57, 27.62, 27.65, 27.83, 28.01, 28.04, … $ air_temp_c &lt;dbl&gt; 27.15, 27.02, 27.00, 26.93, 26.84, 26.94, 27.04, 27.11, … $ humidity &lt;dbl&gt; 79.6, 75.8, 76.5, 76.2, 76.4, 76.7, 76.5, 78.3, 78.6, 76… $ wind_ew &lt;dbl&gt; -6.4, -5.3, -5.1, -4.9, -3.5, -4.4, -2.0, -3.7, -4.2, -3… $ wind_ns &lt;dbl&gt; 5.4, 5.3, 4.5, 2.5, 4.1, 1.6, 3.5, 4.5, 5.0, 3.5, 2.9, 1… $ year_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ latitude_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ longitude_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ sea_temp_c_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ air_temp_c_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ humidity_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ wind_ew_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… $ wind_ns_NA &lt;fct&gt; !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !NA, !… 6.5.1 Relationship with other variables ggplot(data = tao_shadow, aes(x = wind_ew, y=wind_ns, colour=air_temp_c_NA)) + scale_colour_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) What do we learn? The lowest values of east-west winds have no missing values. Maybe it is less likely to have air temperature missing values when there are light east-west winds? 6.5.2 Two minute challenge Generate the shadow matrix and make a plot of the winds, coloured by missingness on humidity. ggplot(data = tao_shadow, aes(x = wind_ew, y=wind_ns, colour=humidity_NA)) + scale_colour_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + geom_point(alpha=0.7) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) 6.6 Strategy An small fraction of cases have several missings, drop the cases A variable or two, out of many, have a lot of missings, drop the variables If missings are small in number, but located in many cases and variables, you need to impute these values, to do most analyses Designing the imputation should take into account dependencies that you have seen between missingness and existing variables. For the ocean buoys data this means imputation needs to be done separately by year 6.7 Common ways to impute values Simple parametric: use the mean or median of the complete cases for each variable Simple non-parametric: find the \\(k\\) nearest neighbours with a complete value and average these Multiple imputation: Use a statistical distribution, e.g. normal model and simulate a value (or set of values, hot deck imputation) for the missings 6.7.1 Mean ignoring year. tao_shadow &lt;- tao_shadow %&gt;% impute_mean_at(vars(sea_temp_c, air_temp_c)) ggplot(tao_shadow, aes(x = sea_temp_c, y = air_temp_c, colour = air_temp_c_NA)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.7) + facet_wrap(~year) + scale_colour_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) What do we learn?

The imputed values are closer to the complete case values However, they form a rigid line, mismatching the variation and they extend outside the range of complete values. This is a problem in that the imputed air temperature value for these high sea temperature cases is lower than we would expect, and thus possibly impeding good model fitting 6.7.3 Two minute challenge Change the code to plot sea temperature against humidity, with colour representing missing humidity values.

What do you learn about the imputations? 6.8 Exercise We are going to examine Melbourne house prices, using a data set available at https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market). It was constructed by scraping the auction reports over several years, and adding more information on property details by scraping the web pages on the properties at domain.com. Make an overview plot of the full data. Which variables have missings? Focus ONLY on the variables Price, Rooms, Type, Distance, Bedroom2, Bathroom. Remove the observations that have missing values on Price, because this is the response variable that we want to ultimately predict. We can’t build a stable model for price if we don’t know the price. Make a missing values summary of all the data - what proportion of observations are missing on Price? Make the shadow matrix, and plot Bathroom vs Bedroom2 coloured by missingness on Bedroom2. Why don’t any missing values show up? Impute the missing values for Bedroom2 and Bathroom, by using mean imputation. Make a plot of the two variables, with the imputed values coloured. Describe the pattern that you see. Impute the missing values for Bedroom2 and Bathroom, using a linear model on th variable Rooms. Make a plot of the two variables, with the imputed values coloured. Is this better or worse than the mean value imputed values? Explain your thinking.

With the grammar, a data plot becomes a statistic. It is a functional mapping from variable to graphical element. Then we can do statistics on data plots. With a grammar, we don’t have individual animals in the zoo, we have the genetic code that says how one plot is related to another plot. 7.1.3 Elements of the grammar ggplot(data = &lt;DATA&gt;) + &lt;GEOM_FUNCTION&gt;( mapping = aes(&lt;MAPPINGS&gt;), stat = &lt;STAT&gt;, position = &lt;POSITION&gt; ) + &lt;COORDINATE_FUNCTION&gt; + &lt;FACET_FUNCTION&gt; The 7 key elements of the grammar are: DATA GEOM_FUNCTION MAPPINGS STAT POSITION COORDINATE_FUNCTION FACET_FUNCTION 7.2 Example: Tuberculosis data Data on tuberculosis incidence can be found at the World Health Organisation. The case notifications table has been downloaded. We will look at the incidence in Australia. The steps to organising the data are: Select the variables, country name and iso3 code, year and the incidence columns as measured by a sputum test. The incidence columns also encode age and gender. Gather the data into long form, so that gender and age can be put in separate columns. Filter out records for Australia, between years 1997-2012. We also remove values for under 15 because the coding of these age groups is contradictory. library(tidyverse) tb &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/TB_notifications_2018-03-18.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(country, iso3, year, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% gather(stuff, count, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% separate(stuff, c(&quot;stuff1&quot;, &quot;stuff2&quot;, &quot;genderage&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-stuff1, -stuff2) %&gt;% mutate(gender=substr(genderage, 1, 1), age=substr(genderage, 2, length(genderage))) %&gt;% select(-genderage) tb_au &lt;- tb %&gt;% filter(country == &quot;Australia&quot;) %&gt;% filter(!(age %in% c(&quot;04&quot;, &quot;014&quot;, &quot;514&quot;, &quot;u&quot;))) %&gt;% filter(year &gt; 1996, year &lt; 2013) We want to look at this data with lots of plots in different ways, with different mappings, to learn different things. 7.2.1 100% charts ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;fill&quot;) + facet_grid(~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) 100% charts, is what excel names these beasts. What do we learn? 7.2.1.1 Code structure Basic plot function is ggplot First argument provided is the name of the data, tb_au Variable mapping: year is mapped to x, count is mapped to y, gender is mapped to colour, and age is used to subset the data and make separate plots The bar geom is used, geom_bar We have already counted how many TB incidences are in each combination of categories, so stat = \"identity\" says no need to compute the count We are mostly interested in proportions between gender, over years, separately by age. The position = \"fill\" option in geom_bar sets the heights of the bars to be all at 100%. It ignores counts, and emphasizes the proportion of males and females. 7.2.1.2 What do we learn? Focus is on proportion in each category. Across (almost) all ages, and years, the proportion of males having TB is higher than females These proportions tend to be higher in the older age groups, for all years. 7.2.2 Bar charts ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + facet_grid(~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) 7.2.2.1 What is different in the code description? , position = \"fill\" was removed 7.2.2.2 What do we learn? Focus is on counts in each category. Different across ages, and years, counts tend to be lower in middle age (45-64) 1999 saw a bit of an outbreak, in most age groups, with numbers doubling or tripling other years. Incidence has been increasing among younger age groups in recent years. 7.2.3 Side-by-side barcharts ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_grid(~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) 7.2.3.1 What is different in the code description? , position=\"dodge\" is used in geom_bar 7.2.3.2 What do we learn? Focus is on counts by gender, predominantly male incidence. Incidence among males relative to females is from middle ag on. There is similar incidence between males and females in younger age groups. 7.2.4 Separate bar charts ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + facet_grid(gender ~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) 7.2.4.1 What is different in the code description? facet_grid(gender ~ age) + faceted by gender as well as age, note facet_grid vs facet_wrap 7.2.4.2 What do we learn? Its easier to focus separately on males and females. The 1999 outbreak mostly affected males. The growing incidence in the 25-34 age group is still affecting females but seems to be have stablised for males. 7.2.5 Pie charts? ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = year, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + facet_grid(gender ~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) + coord_polar() + theme(axis.text = element_blank()) Nope! That’s a rose chart. Bar charts in polar coordinates produce rose charts. 7.2.5.1 What is different in the code description? coord_polar() + plot is made in polar coordinates, rather than the default Cartesian coordinates 7.2.5.2 What do we learn? Emphasizes the middle years as low incidence. 7.2.6 Rainbow charts? ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;fill&quot;) + facet_grid(gender ~ age) A single stacked bar, in each facet. Year is mapped to colour. 7.2.6.1 What is the code doing? Notice how the mappings are different. A single number is mapped to x, that makes a single stacked bar chart. year is now mapped to colour (that’s what gives us the rainbow charts!) 7.2.6.2 What do we learn? Pretty chart but not easy to interpret. 7.2.7 Pie charts ggplot(tb_au, aes(x = 1, y = count, fill = factor(year))) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;fill&quot;) + facet_grid(gender ~ age) + coord_polar(theta=&quot;y&quot;) + theme(axis.text = element_blank()) 7.2.7.1 What is different in the code description? coord_polar(theta=\"y\") is using the y variable to do the angles for the polar coordinates to give a pie chart. 7.2.7.2 What do we learn? Pretty chart but not easy to interpret, or make comparisons across age groups. 7.2.7.3 Your turn Focus on a different country and work your way through the plots where we learned the most about the Australia data. Is the incidence similar for this country? Are rates increasing? Or decreasing? Do some age groups experience higher rates? Is it more prevalent among males? 7.3 Variable types and mapping Type of variable How to map Common errors Categorical, qualitative Category + count/proportion displayed, often as an area plot or with a small number of categories mapped to colour or symbol Not including 0 on the count/proportion axis. Not ordering categories. Quantitative Position along an axis Displaying as a bar, especially when showing mean values. Mapping to colour. Date/Time Time-ordered axis, different temporal resolutions to study long term trend, or seasonal patterns. Lines typically connect measurements to indicate temporal dependence Time order corrupted Space Conventional projections of the sphere, map aspect ratio Wrong aspect ratio 7.4 Coordinate systems Cartesian, polar: most plots are made in Cartesian coordinates. Just a few are in polar coordinates, primarily the pie chart. Polar coordinates use radius and angle to describe position in 2D space. Occasionally measurements like wind (direction and speed) make sense to be plotted in polar coordinates. fixed, equal: When variables are made on scales that should be comparable, it may be important to reflect this in the axes limits and page space that the plot takes. (This is different from theme(aspect.ratio=1) which sets the physical size of the plot to be the same, or in some ratio.) map: Maps come in conventional formats, most often with a specific aspect ratio of vertical to horizontal axes, that depends on latitude. flip: Useful for generating a plot with a categorical variable on the x axis and then flipping it sideways to look at. df &lt;- tibble(x=runif(100), y=runif(100)*10) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + coord_fixed() ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + coord_equal() ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + coord_fixed(ratio=0.2) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + theme(aspect.ratio=1) 7.5 Layering Statistical summaries: It is common to layer plots, particularly by adding statistical summaries, like a model fit, or means and standard deviations. The purpose is to show the trend in relation to the variation. Maps: Commonly maps provide the framework for data collected spatially. One layer for the map, and another for the data. df &lt;- tibble(x=runif(100), y1=4*x + rnorm(100), y2= -x + 10*(x-0.5)^2+ rnorm(100)) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y1)) + geom_point() ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y1)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=FALSE) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y1)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y2)) + geom_point() ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=&quot;lm&quot;, se=FALSE) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y2)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) 7.6 Colour palettes Qualitative: categorical variables Sequential: low to high numeric values Diverging: negative to positive values 7.6.1 Choropleth map # Read the tb data tb &lt;- read_csv(&quot;data/TB_notifications_2018-03-18.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(country, year, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% gather(stuff, count, new_sp_m04:new_sp_fu) %&gt;% separate(stuff, c(&quot;stuff1&quot;, &quot;stuff2&quot;, &quot;genderage&quot;)) %&gt;% select(-stuff1, -stuff2) %&gt;% mutate(gender=substr(genderage, 1, 1), age=substr(genderage, 2, length(genderage))) %&gt;% select(-genderage) # Compute relative difference between 2012 and 2002 tb_inc &lt;- tb %&gt;% filter(year %in% c(2002, 2012)) %&gt;% group_by(country, year) %&gt;% summarise(count = sum(count, na.rm=TRUE)) %&gt;% spread(year, count) %&gt;% mutate(reldif = ifelse(`2002` == 0, 0, (`2012`-`2002`)/(`2002`))) %&gt;% ungroup() # Join with a world map library(maps) library(ggthemes) world_map &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;) # Names of countries need to be the same in both data tables tb_inc &lt;- tb_inc %&gt;% mutate(country=recode(country, &quot;United States of America&quot;=&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;=&quot;UK&quot;, &quot;Russian Federation&quot;=&quot;Russia&quot;)) tb_map &lt;- left_join(world_map, tb_inc, by=c(&quot;region&quot;=&quot;country&quot;)) 7.6.1.1 Sequential Default ggplot(tb_map) + geom_polygon(aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=reldif)) + theme_map() Modified rainbow library(viridis) ggplot(tb_map) + geom_polygon(aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=reldif)) + theme_map() + scale_fill_viridis(na.value = &quot;white&quot;) 7.6.1.2 Diverging ggplot(tb_map) + geom_polygon(aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=reldif)) + theme_map() + scale_fill_distiller(palette=&quot;PRGn&quot;, na.value = &quot;white&quot;, limits = c(-7, 7)) 7.7 Colour blindness About 10% of men have some form of colorblindness; less than 0.2% of women are affected. The most common type of color deficiency causes difficulty distinguishing between red and green. There are several colour blind tested palettes: RColorbrewer has an associated web site colorbrewer.org where the palettes are labelled, and the colorblind package has palettes which are safe for various types of color deficiency. You can test your color choices for different forms of colorblindness using the dichromat package. Below is the same plot usng the default two colour scheme of ggplot, and what it looks like to a person with red/green colorblindness. As there are many mutations which can lead to different severities of color deficiency, simulations are not 100% accurate. A foolproof way to ensure your color palettes are distinguishable is to print them in black and white. If all colors can be distinguished, then your palette is safe to use for all types of colorblindness. library(scales) df &lt;- data.frame(x=runif(100), y=runif(100), cl=sample(c(rep(&quot;A&quot;, 50), rep(&quot;B&quot;, 50)))) p &lt;- ggplot(data=df, aes(x, y, colour=cl)) + theme_bw() + geom_point() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;, aspect.ratio=1) library(dichromat) clrs &lt;- hue_pal()(3) p clrs &lt;- dichromat(hue_pal()(3)) p + scale_colour_manual(&quot;&quot;, values=clrs) 7.8 Pre-attentive Some visual features are “read” without significant cognitive effort and attention.

To answer the question “Is the incidence similar for males and females in 2012 across age groups?” the first arrangement is better. It puts males and females right beside each other, so the relative heights of the bars can be seen quickly. The answer to the question would be “No, the numbers were similar in youth, but males are more affected with increasing age.” The second arrangement puts the focus on age groups, and is better to answer the question “Is the incidence similar for age groups in 2012, across gender?” To which the answer would be “No, among females, the incidence is higher at early ages. For males, the incidence is much more uniform across age groups.” tb_au %&gt;% filter(year == 2012) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = gender, y = count, fill = gender)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_grid( ~ age) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) tb_au %&gt;% filter(year == 2012) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = age, y = count, fill = age)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_grid( ~ gender) + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) 7.10 Hierarchy of mappings Position - common scale (BEST): axis system Position - nonaligned scale: boxes in a side-by-side boxplot Length, direction, angle: pie charts, regression lines, wind maps Area: bubble charts Volume, curvature: 3D plots Shading, color (WORST): maps, points coloured by numeric variable My crowd-sourcing expt Nice explanation by Peter Aldous General plotting advice and a book from Naomi Robbins 7.11 Adding interactivity to plots Interaction on a plot can help de-clutter it, by making labels only show on mouse over.

The statistic term frequency, inverse document frequency, tf-idf, is intended to measure how important a word is to a document in a collection (or corpus) of documents, for example, to one novel in a collection of novels or to one website in a collection of websites. \\(tf_{word} = \\frac{Number~of~times~word~t~appears~in~a~document}{Total~number~of~words~in~the~document}\\) \\(idf_{word} = log \\frac{number~of~documents}{number~of~documents~word~appears~in}\\) \\(td-idf = tf\\times idf\\) darwin1_words &lt;- darwin1_words %&gt;% mutate(edition = &quot;1&quot;) darwin6_words &lt;- darwin6_words %&gt;% mutate(edition = &quot;6&quot;) darwin &lt;- bind_rows(darwin1_words, darwin6_words) darwin &lt;- darwin %&gt;% bind_tf_idf(word, edition, n) darwin %&gt;% arrange(desc(tf_idf)) # A tibble: 15,044 × 7 word n len edition tf idf tf_idf &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 mivart 28 6 6 0.000360 0.693 0.000250 2 prof 28 4 6 0.000360 0.693 0.000250 3 cambrian 27 8 6 0.000347 0.693 0.000241 4 illegitimate 21 12 6 0.000270 0.693 0.000187 5 lamellæ 21 7 6 0.000270 0.693 0.000187 6 pedicellariæ 19 12 6 0.000244 0.693 0.000169 7 dimorphic 18 9 6 0.000232 0.693 0.000160 8 fittest 17 7 6 0.000219 0.693 0.000152 9 orchids 17 7 6 0.000219 0.693 0.000152 10 fritz 15 5 6 0.000193 0.693 0.000134 # ℹ 15,034 more rows darwin %&gt;% arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %&gt;% mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %&gt;% group_by(edition) %&gt;% top_n(15) %&gt;% ungroup %&gt;% ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = edition)) + geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + labs(x = NULL, y = &quot;tf-idf&quot;) + facet_wrap(~edition, ncol = 2, scales = &quot;free&quot;) + coord_flip() + scale_fill_brewer(palette=&quot;Dark2&quot;) What do we learn?

It is section 3.4. 8.10 Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis tags words or phrases with an emotion, and summarises these, often as the positive or negative state, over a body of text. Examples of use are: Examining effect of emotional state in twitter posts Determining public reactions to government policy, or new product releases Trying to make money in the stock market by modeling social media posts on listed companies Evaluating product reviews on Amazon, restaurants on zomato, or travel options on TripAdvisor 8.10.1 Lexicons The tidytext package has a lexicon of sentiments, based on four major sources: AFINN, bing, Loughran, nrc (Mohammad and Turney 2013) XXX Cite these lexicon sources sentiments %&gt;% count(sentiment, sort=TRUE) # A tibble: 2 × 2 sentiment n &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; 1 negative 4781 2 positive 2005 sentiments # A tibble: 6,786 × 2 word sentiment &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 2-faces negative 2 abnormal negative 3 abolish negative 4 abominable negative 5 abominably negative 6 abominate negative 7 abomination negative 8 abort negative 9 aborted negative 10 aborts negative # ℹ 6,776 more rows What emotion do these words elicit in you? summer hot chips hug lose stolen smile 8.10.1.1 Different sources The nrc lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion (“yes”/“no”) into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. The bing lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories. The AFINN lexicon assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment. get_sentiments(&quot;afinn&quot;) # A tibble: 2,477 × 2 word value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 abandon -2 2 abandoned -2 3 abandons -2 4 abducted -2 5 abduction -2 6 abductions -2 7 abhor -3 8 abhorred -3 9 abhorrent -3 10 abhors -3 # ℹ 2,467 more rows 8.10.2 Analysis Once you have a bag of words, you need to join the sentiments dictionary to the words data. Particularly the lexicon nrc has multiple tags per word, so you may need ot use an “inner_join”. inner_join() returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

There are various ways to specify day of the week, as a number (this can be confusing, which is 1, Sunday, Monday or even Saturday) or text, or abbreviated text. When we talk with people we would like to use the day name, but operating on days might be useful to have it represented as a number. wday(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;) [1] 6 wday(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;, label = TRUE) [1] Fri Levels: Sun &lt; Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat wday(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE) [1] Friday 7 Levels: Sunday &lt; Monday &lt; Tuesday &lt; Wednesday &lt; Thursday &lt; ... &lt; Saturday wday(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;, label = TRUE, week_start = 1) [1] Fri Levels: Mon &lt; Tue &lt; Wed &lt; Thu &lt; Fri &lt; Sat &lt; Sun Similarly, we can extract what month the day is in. month(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;) [1] 8 month(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;, label = TRUE) [1] Aug 12 Levels: Jan &lt; Feb &lt; Mar &lt; Apr &lt; May &lt; Jun &lt; Jul &lt; Aug &lt; Sep &lt; ... &lt; Dec month(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE) [1] August 12 Levels: January &lt; February &lt; March &lt; April &lt; May &lt; June &lt; ... &lt; December Fiscally, it can be useful to know what quarter the day is in. quarter(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;) [1] 3 semester(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;) [1] 2 Similarly, we can select days within a year. yday(&quot;2018-08-10&quot;) [1] 222 9.3 Example: pedestrian sensor The Melbourne pedestrian sensor portal contains hourly counts of people walking around the city.

Similarly months have different numbers of days. 9.3.3 To think about Brainstorm with your table a solution, to answer these questions: Are pedestrian counts different depending on the month?

Remember layout is done to place nodes that are more similar close together in the display. The colours indicate conference the team belongs too. For the most part, conferences are clustered, more similar to each other than other conferences. There are some clusters of conference groups, eg Mid-American, Big East, and Atlantic Coast The Independents are independent Some teams play far afield from their conference. 11.3 Example: Harry Potter characters Source: wikicommons There is a connection between two students if one provides emotional support to the other at some point in the book.

Debby Swayne, famous for her work on XGobi [XXX], and GGobi [XXX], liked to say that probability was what she found hardest about learning statistics. Her example was a coin flip. She observed the result of a coin flip, and so there was nothing uncertain. It either was a head or a tail. Maybe this transition is hard for many people. Once we have observed something, it is difficult to step backwards and imagine the uncertainty – “hindsight is 20/20”. Debby took issue with the teaching of the probability of a head for a coin flip being \\(1/2\\). Prior to tossing the coin, assuming that it is a fair coin, we are told that the probability, or the long term average, for observing a head is the same as for a tail, a half. Half the time, the coin will show a head and half the time it will show a tail. This thinking assumes that someone tosses the coin for their entire life and beyond. Not enough emphasis is given to once the event has happened, the result is known. It either occurred or didn’t occur, probability 1 or 0. The former is a vague concept, but the latter is a certainty. This has a name, hindsight bias, which is the inclination after an event has occurred to see it as predictable. It is also called knew-it-all-along effect or creeping determinism (wikipedia). We often have the sample in hand, which is like seeing the result of the coin flip, without knowing what the original options were.

Image source: Anton Croos Art of Photography 16.2 Why models? a simple low-dimensional summary of a dataset family of models express a relationship between different variables. allows us to predict outcomes of interest, given other variables! prediction is critical in many fields 16.2.1 Example 16.2.2 Model families A model family is the functional form that describes a relationship between an outcome \\((Y)\\) and an input, covariate, pre-determined variable \\((X)\\), e.g. \\(f(X)=b_0 + b_1 X +b_2 X^2+...+b_p X^p\\) \\(f(X)=b_0\\exp(b_1X)\\) \\(f(X_1, X_2)=b_0 + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_1^2 + b_3 X_2\\) The fitted model makes this explicit (\\(e\\) is the residual) \\(y_i = 2+3x_i+x_i^2-2x_i^3+e_i, i=1, ...., n\\) or \\(\\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3\\) \\(y_i=3\\exp(2x_i)+e_i\\) or \\(\\widehat{y}=3\\exp(2x)\\) \\(y_i=-5 + 4 x_{i1} - 2 x_{i1}^2 + 10x_{i2}+e_i\\) or \\(\\widehat{y}=-5 + 4 x- 2 x^2+ 10x\\) library(tidyverse) library(gridExtra) # This sets the domain of the function to be -1, 1 # and randomly generates values in this domain x &lt;- runif(100, -1, 1) df &lt;- tibble(x, y=2+3*x+x^2-2*x^3+rnorm(100)*0.2) p1 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() df &lt;- tibble(x, y=3*exp(2*x)+rnorm(100)*0.5) p2 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() x1 &lt;- runif(200, -1, 1) x2 &lt;- runif(200, -1, 1) df &lt;- tibble(x1, x2, y=-5+4*x1-2*x1^2+10*x2+rnorm(200)*0.1) p3 &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=x1, y=x2, colour=y)) + geom_point(size=3, alpha=0.5) + theme(aspect.ratio=1) grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, ncol=3) 16.2.3 Your turn Try the sample code to generate data with different functional forms Change the domain of the explanatory variable, and see what happens to the shape of the data Make up some new functions, and simulate some samples 16.3 Linear models 16.3.1 Correlation vs linear model Linear association between two variables can be described by correlation, but a multiple regression model can describe linear relationship between a response variable and many explanatory variables. For two variables \\(X, Y\\), correlation is: \\[r=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\\bar{x})^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\bar{y})^2}} = \\frac{cov(X,Y)}{s_xs_y}\\] 16.3.2 Correlation 16.3.3 Simple regression \\[y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i}+\\varepsilon_i, ~~~ i=1, \\dots, n\\] where (least squares) estimates for \\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1\\) are: \\[b_1 = r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}, ~~~~~~~~ b_0=\\bar{y}-b_1\\bar{x}\\] Slope is related to correlation, but it also depends on the variation of observations, in both of the variables. 16.3.4 Multiple regression model \\[y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}+\\dots +\\beta_px_{ip}+\\varepsilon_i, ~~~ i=1, \\dots, n\\] where \\(\\varepsilon\\) is a sample from a normal distribution, \\(N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). 16.3.5 What a model says The fitted model allows us to predict a value for the response, e.g. Suppose \\(\\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3\\), then for \\(x=0.5, \\widehat{y}=2+3*0.5+0.5^2-2*0.5^3=3.5\\) Suppose \\(\\widehat{y}=3\\exp(2x)\\), then for \\(x=-1, \\widehat{y}=3\\exp(2*(-1))=0.406\\) How useful the model prediction is depends on the residual error. If the model explains little of the relationship then the residual error will be large and predictions less useful. Predictions within the domain of the explanatory variables used to fit the model will be more reliable than extrapolating outside the domain. Particularly this is true for nonlinear models. 16.4 Let’s fit a model to CO2 library(lubridate) CO2.spo &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/assets/data/atmospheric/stations/merged_in_situ_and_flask/daily/daily_merge_co2_spo.csv&quot;, col_names=c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;time&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, &quot;decdate&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;flg&quot;, &quot;co2&quot;), skip=71) %&gt;% mutate(lat = -90.0, lon = 0, stn = &quot;spo&quot;) %&gt;% filter(flg==0) %&gt;% mutate(date = ymd(date)) ggplot(CO2.spo, aes(x=date, y=co2)) + geom_point() 16.4.1 Try a linear fit CO2.spo # A tibble: 1,271 × 10 date time day decdate n flg co2 lat lon stn &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; 1 1957-06-17 00:00 20988 1957. 1 0 313. -90 0 spo 2 1957-12-22 00:00 21176 1958. 1 0 314. -90 0 spo 3 1957-12-23 00:00 21177 1958. 1 0 314. -90 0 spo 4 1958-03-21 00:00 21265 1958. 1 0 314. -90 0 spo 5 1958-03-22 06:30 21266. 1958. 2 0 314. -90 0 spo 6 1958-06-20 00:00 21356 1958. 1 0 315. -90 0 spo 7 1958-09-27 00:00 21455 1959. 1 0 315. -90 0 spo 8 1958-09-28 00:00 21456 1959. 1 0 315. -90 0 spo 9 1959-01-08 00:00 21558 1959. 1 0 315. -90 0 spo 10 1959-01-12 00:00 21562 1959. 1 0 315. -90 0 spo # ℹ 1,261 more rows Use the day variable as the explanatory variable.

Plotting the residuals against fitted values (or x in simple linear models) can reveal problems with the fit. ggplot(co2_model, aes(x=date, y=.std.resid)) + geom_point() 16.4.5 Assessment of fit The relationship between co2 and day0 is nonlinear! The linear model does a reasonable job of explaining the increasing trend over time, but it especially mismatches the observed data at the ends, and middle of the time period. 16.4.6 Your turn Try to add a quadratic term (in day0), or more, to the model to improve the fit. Hints: (1) you may want to centre the day0 values, or even standardise them, to get a nice quadratic form, (2) If the fit is good, your residual vs fitted plot should have values evenly spread above and below 0, and relatively even across the time span. 16.5 Model basics in R Formula response ~ explanatory specifies the reponse variable and explanatory variable from the data e.g. y ~ x1+x2+x3 three explanatory variables to be used to model response, main effects only y ~ x1*x2*x3 include interaction terms y ~ x - 1 specifies to force model to go through 0, that \\(b_0\\) will be set to 0. Extract components using the broom package tidy extracts the coefficients augment extracts residuals and fitted values, and pointwise diagnostics glance extracts model fit summaries 16.6 Seasonality 16.6.1 Your turn Below we have a plot the residuals on a short time frame, you can see that there is some seasonality. Values are high in spring, and low in autumn! Brainstorm with your table members - yes, please talk with each other - ideas on how to fit a model that takes seasonality into account. There are multiple solutions, and maybe some that we haven’t thought of. 16.7 Predict co2 at another location 16.7.1 Your turn Using your model, built using values collected the south pole sensor, see how well it fits values from Point Barrow, Alaska. Download the data. You can use almost the same code as for SPO but check the file name at http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/ptb. The code below is a way to fit new data. It needs a bit of modification. co2_model_ptb &lt;- augment(co2_fit2, newdata=CO2.ptb) Plot the data, and overlay the fitted model. You can use code like this. ggplot(co2_model, aes(x=date, y=co2)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(y=.fitted), colour=&quot;blue&quot;) 16.8 Using optimisation to get a good fit GOAL: Fitted model is close to all observed points APPROACH: Measure the distance between the observed and fitted value, for each observation. SOLUTION: Best model makes all these distances as small as possible 16.8.1 Typical distances Squared: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{y_i})^2\\) (Fit is called least squares fit) Absolute: \\(\\sum_{i}|~y_i - \\widehat{y_i}~|\\) (Fit called least absolute deviations) Power \\(p\\): \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\widehat{y_i})^p\\) (\\(p=2,4,6,... L_p\\) distance) Let’s take a look, for the examples from last lecture. Data is simulated from this model: \\(\\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3\\) We know that \\(\\beta_0=2, \\beta_1=3, \\beta_2=1, \\beta_3=-2\\). From the data, assume we DO NOT KNOW these parameter values, (but that we do know the model family) and we will estimate the parameters from the data provided. We need to find values for \\(b_0, b_1, b_2, b_3\\) that minimise the distance between the resulting fitted value (\\(\\widehat{y}\\)) and the observed \\(y\\). square_err &lt;- function(par, data) { sq &lt;- sum((data$y-(par[1]+par[2]*data$x+par[3]*data$x^2+par[4]*data$x^3))^2) return(sq) } fit &lt;- optim(c(1,1,1,1), square_err, data=df) df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(fitted = fit$par[1] + fit$par[2]*x + fit$par[3]*x^2 + fit$par[4]*x^3) ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_point() + geom_line(aes(y=fitted), colour=&quot;blue&quot;) 16.8.2 Your turn Get my code to work for you. Your results might vary slightly from mine, because it is generating a different sample or data, and this might result in different parameter estimates Write a function to compute least absolute deviation, and run the optimisation with this instead of least squares Plot the data, least squares line, and the least absolute deviation model fits. 16.9 Components of variation total variation: how much does Y vary, which is what we want to explain using the other variables variation explained by the model residual variation: what’s left over after fitting the model Open the app available at https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/. (The original version was obtained from https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression, developed by Gustavo Brant Paterno, a PhD student from Brazil.) The app simulates some data using different slopes and error variance. It allows you to see how characteristics of the data affect model summaries. Time to play! Vary the slope from high positive to zero. What happens to the error variance? The total variance and the regression variance (due to model)? Does the proportion of variation of each component change? How? Is this the same if you vary from large negative slope to zero? Holding the slope fixed at 1, increase the standard deviation of the error model. What happens to components of variation? As the slope changes, what happens to the intercept? Why isn’t the estimated slope the same as what is set by the slider? 16.10 Model goodness of fit statistics Simulate data again from this model: \\(\\widehat{y}=2+3x+x^2-2x^3\\) Then consider these two models: \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2\\) \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+b_3x^3\\) Model 2 would be the correct family, because it matches how we generated the data. The model goodness of fit statistics should reflect this. library(broom) df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(x2=x^2, x3=x^3) df_mod1 &lt;- lm(y~x+x2, data=df) df_mod2 &lt;- lm(y~x+x2+x3, data=df) glance(df_mod1) # A tibble: 1 × 12 r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.882 0.879 0.390 361. 1.16e-45 2 -46.2 100. 111. # ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt; glance(df_mod2) # A tibble: 1 × 12 r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic p.value df logLik AIC BIC &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 0.971 0.970 0.195 1065. 1.62e-73 3 23.9 -37.7 -24.7 # ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt; The statistics are: \\(R^2\\): (model variance)/(total variance), the amount of variance in response explained by the model. Always ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. Adding more variables to the model will always increase \\(R^2\\), so what is important is how big an increase is gained. Adjusted \\(R^2\\) reduces this for every additional variable added. Deviance is the residual variation, how much variation in response that IS NOT explained by the model. The close to 0 the better, but it is not on a standard scale. In comparing two models if one has substantially lower deviance, then it is a better model. Similarly BIC (Bayes Information Criterion) indicates how well the model fits, best used to compare two models. The lower is better. df is the degrees of freedom left from the model fit. Starts at \\(n\\) (sample size) and drops for each additional parameter estimated by the model. All of these statistics indicate the model 2 is substantially a better fit than model 1. 16.10.1 Your turn: For the co2 model fitting from yesterday, examine the model fit statistics for the linear model vs the one with a quadratic term. What do they indicate is the better fit? Try fitting the seasonal pattern with one of the ideas you came up with yesterday.

Generally the relationship is negative: this means that if a country started with a high intercept tends to have lower rate of increase. There is a difference across the continents: Countries in Europe and Oceania tended to start with higher life expectancy and increased; countries in Asia and America tended to start lower but have high rates of improvement; Africa tends to start lower and have a huge range in rate of change.

That is, a different slope needs to be used/estimated for each level. Let’s take a look at how this works for the 2015 OECD PISA data. The question to be answered is whether more time spent studying science is associated with higher science scores, and how this varies with enjoyment of science. There are two possible models: \\(y_i = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}+\\beta_2x_{i2}+\\varepsilon_i\\) (Model 1) \\(y_i = \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_{i1}+\\beta_2x_{i2}+\\beta_3x_{i1}*x_{i2}+\\varepsilon_i\\) (Model 2) where \\(y=\\) science score, \\(x_1=\\) science study time, \\(x_2=\\) science enjoyment. Model 2 has an interaction term. This means that the slope will be allowed to vary for the different levels of the categorical variables, science_fun. Note: Ordered factors are treated as “numeric” in the default model fit, so we should convert science_fun to be an unordered categorical variable. Also, science_time is heavily skewed so should be transformed. pisa_au_science &lt;- pisa_au_science %&gt;% mutate(log_science_time = log10(science_time)) %&gt;% mutate(science_fun_c = factor(science_fun, ordered=FALSE)) mod1 &lt;- lm(science~log_science_time+science_fun_c, data=pisa_au_science, weights = stuweight) mod2 &lt;- lm(science~log_science_time*science_fun_c, data=pisa_au_science, weights = stuweight) tidy(mod1) # A tibble: 5 × 5 term estimate std.error statistic p.value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 (Intercept) 268. 14.6 18.3 1.26e- 73 2 log_science_time 83.8 6.18 13.6 1.31e- 41 3 science_fun_c2 31.8 3.15 10.1 9.28e- 24 4 science_fun_c3 63.1 2.80 22.5 7.17e-110 5 science_fun_c4 104. 3.25 32.1 3.00e-216 tidy(mod2) # A tibble: 8 × 5 term estimate std.error statistic p.value &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 (Intercept) 463. 43.5 10.6 2.37e-26 2 log_science_time -0.00400 18.6 -0.000215 1.00e+ 0 3 science_fun_c2 -152. 55.5 -2.74 6.18e- 3 4 science_fun_c3 -167. 48.1 -3.46 5.33e- 4 5 science_fun_c4 -122. 53.6 -2.29 2.23e- 2 6 log_science_time:science_fun_c2 78.6 23.8 3.31 9.33e- 4 7 log_science_time:science_fun_c3 98.4 20.6 4.78 1.74e- 6 8 log_science_time:science_fun_c4 96.9 22.8 4.25 2.11e- 5 16.19.2 Five minute challenge Write out the equations for both models.

Approach: Start simply, fit main effects models (single best variable, adding several more variables independently) and try to understand the effect that each has in the model. Explore transformations with the aim to build a stable foundation of explanatory variables for the model. Check model diagnostics, residual plots. Explore two variable interactions, and understand effect on model. Explore three variable interactions. Use model goodness of fit to help decide on final. There may be more than one model that are almost equally as good. Aside: Ideally, values of explanatory variables cover all possible combinations in their domain. There should not be any association between explanatory variables. If there is, then the there is more uncertainty in the parameter estimates. Its like building a table with only two legs, that table would be a bit wobbly, and unstable. A work around is to first regress one explanatory variable on the other, and add the residuals from this fit to the model, instead of the original variable. That is, suppose \\(X_1, X_2\\) are strongly linearly associated, then model \\(X_2\\sim b_0+b_1X_1+e\\), and use \\(e\\) (call it \\(X^*_2\\)) in the model instead of \\(X_2\\). You would then only be using the part of \\(X_2\\) that is not related to \\(X_1\\) to expand the model. This approach can be used for multiple explanatory variables that are associated. 16.20.1 Lab exercise Build the best model you can for science score, by exploring these variables: math score, reading score, tvs, books, breakfast, feel free to choose others.

What we cannot see from the boxplots is that some of these airline carriers have several modes for the number of miles that their planes fly. United and American seem to have a couple of planes that fly only very rarely. Carrier AS has two modes: one mode at a very high number of miles, the other at around 75,000 miles. All times in the ontime data set are in local time. This is problematic for almost any data analysis. Even ordering flights by their departure time over the course of a day is not possible unless we are only considering flights in the same time zone. Because all of the locations we are interested in, are airports, we can make use of the National Transportation Atlas Database provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. In this database, airports are listed with geographic location in latitude and longitude. library(foreign) airports &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;data/airlines/airports/airports.dbf&quot;) # we can reduce our data set to airports only table(airports$LAN_FA_TY) AIRPORT BALLOONPORT GLIDERPORT HELIPORT SEAPLANE BASE 13613 13 35 5657 496 ULTRALIGHT 135 airports &lt;- subset(airports, LAN_FA_TY==&quot;AIRPORT&quot;) ggplot(data = airports) + geom_point(aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE)) # qplot(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, data=airports) There are a slew of different approaches and (semi-free) online services available to resolve issues around time zones.

We then sort flights according to their (scheduled) departure date and time. LastDest introduces a variable specifying the last destination a plane has flown into - if things go well, this should be the same as the origin from where the next flight is scheduled to take off. If LastDest and Origin are different airports, this indicates that at least one ghost flight has taken place, because the plane had to move somehow from its last destination to the new origin. ghosts &lt;- ontime %&gt;% filter(TailNum != &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% group_by(TailNum) %&gt;% select( TailNum, Departure, FlightDate, Origin, Dest, Cancelled, UniqueCarrier ) %&gt;% filter(Cancelled == 0) %&gt;% arrange(Departure) %&gt;% mutate( LastDest = lag(Dest), Ghost = !(Origin == LastDest) ) %&gt;% filter(Ghost) dim(ghosts) [1] 6951 9 There are 9651 ghost flights in January 2016 (*** not adjusted by timezone - this might change a couple of flights ***).

The size of the dots is proportional to the number of flights the airline carried out in January 2016, i.e. larger carriers are shown by larger sized dots. Generally, larger carriers have larger ghost rates, but there are some remarkable exceptions. Southwest (WN) has the lowest rate of ghost flights among the larger carriers, while Frontier Airlines (F9) has a very high ghost rate for such a small carrier. ghosts &lt;- merge(ghosts, airports[,c(&quot;LOCID&quot;, &quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, &quot;LATITUDE&quot;)], by.x=&quot;Origin&quot;, by.y=&quot;LOCID&quot;, all.x=TRUE) names(ghosts)[grep(&quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, names(ghosts))] &lt;- &quot;orig.long&quot; names(ghosts)[grep(&quot;LATITUDE&quot;, names(ghosts))] &lt;- &quot;orig.lat&quot; ghosts &lt;- merge(ghosts, airports[,c(&quot;LOCID&quot;, &quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, &quot;LATITUDE&quot;)], by.x=&quot;LastDest&quot;, by.y=&quot;LOCID&quot;, all.x=TRUE) names(ghosts)[grep(&quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, names(ghosts))] &lt;- &quot;dest.long&quot; names(ghosts)[grep(&quot;LATITUDE&quot;, names(ghosts))] &lt;- &quot;dest.lat&quot; ghosts$LastDest &lt;-as.character(ghosts$LastDest) ghosts$Origin &lt;-as.character(ghosts$Origin) ghostPorts &lt;- ghosts %&gt;% split(.$UniqueCarrier) %&gt;% purrr::map_df( function(x) { dframe &lt;- data.frame( UniqueCarrier = x$UniqueCarrier[1], ID = with(x, c(LastDest, Origin))) dframe %&gt;% group_by(UniqueCarrier, ID) %&gt;% summarize( ghosts = n()) } ) ghostPorts &lt;- merge(ghostPorts, airports[,c(&quot;LOCID&quot;, &quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, &quot;LATITUDE&quot;)], by.x=&quot;ID&quot;, by.y=&quot;LOCID&quot;, all.x=TRUE) ghostPorts &lt;- ghostPorts %&gt;% group_by(UniqueCarrier) %&gt;% mutate( ghostPerc = ghosts / sum(ghosts) *100 ) states &lt;- map_data(&quot;state&quot;) ggplot() + theme_bw() + geom_polygon(aes(long, lat, group=group), data=states, fill=&quot;grey80&quot;) + geom_segment(aes(x=orig.long, xend=dest.long, y=orig.lat, yend=dest.lat), data=subset(ghosts, UniqueCarrier %in% c(&quot;OO&quot;, &quot;EV&quot;, &quot;F9&quot;)), colour=&quot;darkorange&quot;, alpha=0.25) + facet_wrap(~UniqueCarrier) + xlim(c(-125, -60)) + ylim(c(25, 50)) + theme_map() + geom_label( aes(LONGITUDE, LATITUDE, label=ID), alpha=0.5, data=subset(ghostPorts, UniqueCarrier %in% c(&quot;OO&quot;, &quot;EV&quot;, &quot;F9&quot;) &amp; ghostPerc &gt; 2.5)) Figure 23.1: Ghost flights of three national airline carriers. Airports with at least 2.5% of the ghost traffic are labelled. 23.1 Flight delays There are two main kind of delays in the US flight data: departure and arrival delays. Obviously, the two delays are correlated - at least at first sight. Figure ?? shows two scatterplots of arrival and departure delays for each of the 400,000 flights using progressive zooms into the data. The scatterplot on the left shows all departure and arrival delays. The correlation is very strong, particularly for large delays. But if we zoom closer into the actually practically relevant region of delays up to 120 mins, we see a more complex relationship. While there is still a strong linear relationship (on average planes make up 6 mins of departure delay on arrival), a second pattern emerges for planes that leave on time or are even early but land late. 23.1.1 Cancellations? The Department of Transportation is keeping track of four reasons for cancellations: Carrier delays, Weather delays, Security delays and delays due to the National Air System. Three of these reasons were given for cancelled flights in January 2016, as can be seen in Figure ??. Obviously, cancellations due to weather are most prominent for this timeframe. cancellations &lt;- subset(ontime, Cancelled == 1) levels(cancellations$CancellationCode) &lt;- c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;Carrier&quot;, &quot;Weather&quot;, &quot;National Air System&quot;) ggplot(data = cancellations) + geom_bar(aes(x = CancellationCode)) During January 2016 there is a period of four days (see Figure ??) that caused massive, mainly weather-related cancellations. cancelDay &lt;- cancellations %&gt;% group_by(DayofMonth, CancellationCode) %&gt;% summarize( n = n() ) ggplot(data = cancelDay) + geom_point(aes(x = DayofMonth, y = n)) + facet_wrap(~CancellationCode) Looking closer, these cancellations occur mainly in the North East, where winter storm Jonas dropped 2 feet of snow between Jan 22 and Jan 24. fourdays &lt;- cancellations %&gt;% filter(between(DayofMonth, 22, 25)) %&gt;% group_by(Origin) %&gt;% summarize( n = n() ) fourdays &lt;- merge(fourdays, unique(airports[, c(&quot;LOCID&quot;, &quot;LONGITUDE&quot;, &quot;LATITUDE&quot;)]), by.x=&quot;Origin&quot;, by.y=&quot;LOCID&quot;) ggplot(data = fourdays) + geom_point(aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, size = n)) HH: this still needs some work: it seems that some airports are listed multiple times (where does that happen? it’s not in the original data, some merge went wrong) number of cancellations are less interesting than the rates of cancellations.

This data are part of FARS, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System. Data is available in annual releases going back to 1975. Accident forms change over time, and the corresponding databases with them - e.g. cell phones as a potential contributor to an accident were not on the list back in the 80s. This often makes an analysis of trends over time a bit tricky. Figure 25.1: Overview of where fatal accidents occurred in 2014 Here, we first focus on a single year’s worth of data. The data is released in different formats. Besides SAS, DBF seems to be a staple at the DOT. DBF stands for ‘data base format’, and in R we can read files in this format using the function read.dbf, which is part of the package foreign (R Core Team 2022). Files in SAS format can be read with package sas7bdat (R-sas7bdat?). Generally, files in SAS format are a bit smaller than the ones in DBF, but the read.dbf function is much faster than the read.sas7bdat function. However, the SAS files come with a file called Format.sas, which contains a translation of numerical codes to string values, making results much easier to interpret. Using a bit of our magical text skills, we can get the relevant information out of this file (see Your Turn question #1). the annoying thing about this database is that in Format14.sas the SAS variable names are used, which have not much to do with the DBF variable names, so the applicability of the getLevels function is a bit limited here. Give some idea of the complexity of the data files Figure 25.1 gives an overview of all geographical locations where an accident resulting in at least one fatality was recording in 2014. A pretty detailed roadmap of the US is the result. 25.1 When do people die on the roads? Figure 25.2 gives an overview of when fatal accidents happen on the road: on weekdays, the number of deaths peaks twice a day during times when people commute. During the morning commute the number of deaths shows a small peak with a mode around 6am. A second, much bigger mode follows the afternoon commute with a peak at around 6pm. These peaks in the number of detahs is by far outdone by the number of deaths from fatal accidents on weekend nights and early mornings starting with Friday afternoon and lasting until Sunday around 10pm. library(dplyr) drunk_by_day &lt;- accidents %&gt;% group_by(DAY_WEEK, HOUR) %&gt;% summarize( accidents = n(), deaths = sum(FATALS), drunk = sum(DRUNK_DR*FATALS &gt; 0) ) drunk_by_day$drunkPerc &lt;- with(drunk_by_day, drunk/deaths*100) drunk_by_day$HOUR[drunk_by_day$HOUR == 99] &lt;- NA drunk_by_day$DAY_WEEK &lt;- factor(drunk_by_day$DAY_WEEK) levels(drunk_by_day$DAY_WEEK) &lt;- c(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;) drunk_by_day$DAY_WEEK &lt;- factor(drunk_by_day$DAY_WEEK, levels=c(&quot;Monday&quot;, &quot;Tuesday&quot;, &quot;Wednesday&quot;, &quot;Thursday&quot;, &quot;Friday&quot;, &quot;Saturday&quot;, &quot;Sunday&quot;)) ggplot(data = drunk_by_day) + geom_bar(aes(x = HOUR, weight = deaths), colour = NA) + facet_wrap(~DAY_WEEK, ncol = 4) Figure 25.2: Number of fatalities from car accidents by time of the day and hour of the week. The variable DRUNK_DR is the number of drivers involved in the crash who tested as being above the legal limit of alcohol, i.e. were legally drunk. Days of the week are encoded as 1 for Sunday through 7 for Saturday, the dots in Figure 25.3 show the percentage of accidents in which at least one of the drivers was drunk. On Saturdays and Sundays the percentage of drunk drivers is generally higher, but on all days of the week, fatal accidents that occur after 8 pm and before 5 am have an over 30% chance of involving a drunk driver. During the very early hours of the morning this rate spikes to well over 50% even on weekdays! ggplot(data = drunk_by_day, aes(x = HOUR, y = drunkPerc, group = DAY_WEEK, colour = DAY_WEEK)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) Figure 25.3: Percentage of accidents where at least one of the drivers was legally drunk by day of the week and time of the day. Late nights and early mornings have particularly high frequencies. 25.2 What contributes to fatal accidents? CF is a variable encoding contributing factors. For more than 90% of all accidents no contributing factors are recorded, but for the remainder, the most frequent factors are (14) falling cargo followed by (20) police pursuit (see Figure 25.4 ). enc &lt;- getLevels(&quot;ARF14F&quot;, &quot;data/FARS2014-DBF/Format14.sas&quot;) names(enc) &lt;- c(&quot;CF1&quot;, &quot;Label&quot;) ggplot(data = accidents, aes(x = reorder(CF1, CF1, length))) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() + geom_text(aes(label = Label), y = 1000, data = enc, hjust = 0) Figure 25.4: Number of accidents by contributing factor.

Assuming, individuals on the front left seat are drivers, we see in Figure 25.6 that on weekdays there is not a big difference in the drunk driving pattern between male and female drivers, but starting Friday afternoon and early evening a gap opens up: a higher percentage of men involved in a fata accident are driving drunk than women in the evenings and early morning hours until during Monday mornings the gap closes again. person &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;data/FARS2014-DBF/person.dbf&quot;) driver &lt;- subset(person, SEAT_POS == 11) # front left seat driver$Date &lt;- with(driver, as.Date(sprintf(&quot;2014/%s/%s&quot;, MONTH, DAY))) driver$DAY_WEEK &lt;- lubridate::wday(driver$Date, label=TRUE) drunk &lt;- driver %&gt;% group_by(HOUR, SEX, DAY_WEEK) %&gt;% summarize( n = n(), drunk = sum(DRINKING==1) ) drunk$HOUR[drunk$HOUR==99] &lt;- NA drunk$drunkPerc &lt;- with(drunk, drunk/n*100) drunk$SEX[drunk$SEX &gt; 2] &lt;- NA drunk$SEX &lt;- factor(drunk$SEX) levels(drunk$SEX) &lt;- c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;) ggplot(data = na.omit(drunk), aes(x = HOUR, y = drunkPerc, colour = factor(SEX), group = interaction(SEX, DAY_WEEK))) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + geom_smooth(se = F) + facet_wrap(~DAY_WEEK) Figure 25.6: Percentages of drunk drivers involved in a fatal accident by gender, time of the day and day of the week. Do we see this gap between genders because women are more sensible with alcohol or do they just let somebody else drive? Figure 25.7 gives a comparison of the number of men and women involved in fatal accidents. Overall, there are about twice as many men involved in a fatal accident than there are women. On the driver seat, this difference is even more pronounced: if there is only one person in the car, the odds of that person being a man are about 3:1. When there are two people in the car, the ratio changes again. On the driver seat the odds of male:female change to about 2:1, while on the passenger seat more women are found than man. person &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;data/FARS2014-DBF/person.dbf&quot;) frontseats &lt;- subset(person, SEAT_POS %in% c(11, 13)) frontseats$SEX[frontseats$SEX &gt; 2] &lt;- NA frontseats$SEX &lt;- factor(frontseats$SEX) levels(frontseats$SEX) &lt;- c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;) enc4 &lt;- getLevels(&quot;DRINK14F&quot;, &quot;data/FARS2014-DBF/Format14.sas&quot;) names(enc4) &lt;- c(&quot;DRINKING&quot;, &quot;DRINKINGR&quot;) frontseats &lt;- frontseats %&gt;% group_by(ST_CASE, VEH_NO) %&gt;% mutate(PERSON=n()) frontseats &lt;- subset(frontseats, PERSON &lt; 3) frontseats &lt;- subset(frontseats, SEX %in% c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;)) frontseats &lt;- subset(frontseats, (SEAT_POS == 11) | (PERSON == 2 &amp; SEAT_POS ==13) ) frontseats$SEAT_POS &lt;- factor(frontseats$SEAT_POS) levels(frontseats$SEAT_POS) &lt;- c(&quot;Driver&quot;, &quot;Passenger&quot;) frontseats$DRINKING &lt;- factor(frontseats$DRINKING) levels(frontseats$DRINKING) &lt;- as.vector(enc4$DRINKINGR) ggplot(data=frontseats) + geom_bar(aes(x = DRINKING, fill= SEX), position=&quot;dodge&quot;) + facet_grid(PERSON~SEAT_POS, labeller=&quot;label_both&quot;) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90, hjust=1, vjust=0.5)) Figure 25.7: Number of men and women involved in fatal accidents grouped by number of people in the car and seat.

When we further investigate the demographics of persons involved in fatal accidents, we find some more imbalances between the genders. Figure 25.9 shows the marginal distributions of people involved by age. Once somebody can get a licens (at around age 18), there are huge spikes in the numbers for both genders. A secondary spike at around age 50 is much more pronounced in men than women. person$Alive &lt;- person$DEATH_YR &gt; 2015 person$SEX[person$SEX &gt; 2] &lt;- NA person$AGE[person$AGE &gt; 199] &lt;- NA person$GenderAlive &lt;- with(person, interaction(SEX,Alive)) levels(person$GenderAlive) &lt;- c(&quot;Male/died&quot;, &quot;Female/died&quot;, &quot;Male/alive&quot;, &quot;Female/alive&quot;) person$SEX &lt;- factor(person$SEX) levels(person$SEX) &lt;- c(&quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;) cols &lt;- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n=6, name=&quot;Paired&quot;) ggplot(aes(AGE, fill=GenderAlive), data=subset(person, !is.na(GenderAlive))) + geom_histogram( binwidth=1) + scale_fill_manual(values=cols[c(2,6,1,5)]) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + geom_hline(yintercept=0.5, colour=&quot;white&quot;) + facet_wrap(~SEX) Figure 25.9: Age of persons involved in fatal accidents. Color shows gender and outcome. Both genders show a huge spike in numbers at around age 18. The second spike around age 50 is more pronounced in men than in women. Figure 25.10 shows essentially the same picture, but focuses on outcome of the accident. Light colors indicate survival. Death rates vary a lot by age, and there are some interesting differences between genders: for the first 17 years, death rates for both genders are low and very similar (and probably related to position in the car). Rates then jump to much higher rates: for men aged between 20 and 60 the chance of dying in the car accident when involved in a fatal car crash is almost 50%. For women this probability is about 40%. After age 60 the rates go up steeply. Rates for men stay above the rates for women up to about age 80, when the gender differences disappear again (but there is also not much data to support this statement). ggplot(aes(AGE, fill=GenderAlive), data=subset(person, !is.na(GenderAlive))) + geom_histogram( binwidth=1, position=&quot;fill&quot;, alpha=0.8) + scale_fill_manual(values=cols[c(2,6,1,5)]) + ylab(&quot;proportion&quot;) + theme(legend.position=&quot;none&quot;) + facet_wrap(~SEX) Figure 25.10: Death rates of persons involved in fatal accidents by age and gender. For both genders there is a huge increase in the rate at age 18. Starting around age 50 the rates of death increase. Generally, the rate for a man dying are higher than for a woman. Figure 25.11 puts all of these percentages together. The figure gives an overview of the multinomial distributions conditioned on age.

Color shows gender and outcome. 25.4 Are roads getting safer? First we read in data at five year intervals starting with 1975. In 2000, we switch to yearly updates, because, as can be seen in Figure 25.12 during this time frame things change most dramatically in terms of the number of accidents. At the same time (see Figure 25.13), the rate at which people die in fatal accidents drops as well. require(foreign) files &lt;- dir(&quot;data/FARS-allyears/&quot;, pattern=&quot;dbf&quot;, ignore.case=TRUE) accidents &lt;- list() for (fidx in seq_along(files)) { accidents[[fidx]] &lt;- read.dbf(file.path(&quot;data/FARS-allyears&quot;, files[fidx])) } accidents[[length(accidents)+1]] &lt;- read.dbf(&quot;data/FARS2014-DBF/accident.dbf&quot;) library(tidyr) library(dplyr) numbers &lt;- data.frame( year = accidents %&gt;% purrr::map_int(.f = function(x) { year &lt;- x$YEAR[1] if (year &lt; 2000) return(as.integer(1900+year[1])) as.integer(year) }), fatalities = accidents %&gt;% purrr::map_dbl(.f = function(x) { sum(x$FATALS) }), n = accidents %&gt;% purrr::map_dbl(nrow) ) write.csv(numbers, &quot;data/numbers.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) numbers &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/numbers.csv&quot;) ggplot(data = numbers) + geom_point(aes(x = year, y = n)) + geom_point(aes(x = year, y = fatalities), colour = &quot;red&quot;) Figure 25.12: Number of accidents (black points) and fatalities (red points) over time. ggplot(data = numbers) + geom_point(aes(x = year, y = fatalities/n)) Figure 25.13: Rate of fatalities per accident in which at least one fatality occurred. The rate decreases over time. The drop in both numbers of fatal accidents over time and the rates of fatalities is even more dramatic, when put into the perspective of how many more cars are on the roads. This kind of information is made available by RITA. RITA got renamed to BTS - none of the websites below exist any more. Need to find them again. Figure @(fig:registration) shows the number (in millions) of registered vehicles over time. Between 1965 and 1993 the number of annual registrations doubles from 100 million to 200 million. Until most recently, the number of registrations increases linearly with an average of about 3.5 Million more vehicles registered each year. Unfortunately, this does not tell us eaxactly how many cars are on the roads each year - for that we would need to also take into account, for how many years people use the same vehicle on average. For the most meaningful measure we would also need to take the number of miles into account that people drive each year. This number would allow us to estimate a rate of fatal accidents per miles driven. *** we could follow up on this, there are a number of interesting sites that deal with estimating the number of annually driven miles - e.g. the travel monitoring at https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/tvt.cfm and the federal reserve bank of St Louis https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/release?rid=254 *** Figure ?? shows the rate of accident fatalities per million registered vehicles over time. Since 1975 this rate has been cut into less than half from over 300 to just over 125 fatalities per million registrations. However, since about 2009 not much progress was made to further reduce the rate (which might go hand in hand with the sub-linear increase in the number of registrations for that same timeframe). 25.5 Your Turn Use the structure you find in file Format14.sas as the basis to write a function getLevels(varname, file) that takes a variable name and a sas file, and returns a dataframe with all levels of the variable in a numeric format and the level names as strings. Was there something wrong with the vehicle? Investigate variable MFACTOR in the Factor.dbf. Make sure to re-code the numbers to strings. Include gender in the discussion of Figure 25.2. (Warning! This question looks harmless, but requires some work.) Where people are when they get involved in an accident matters a lot. Investigate numbers and rates of death by seat position (SEAT_POS). How do age and gender factor into this? Make sure to investigate only combinations with enough data support. Fatal accidents by state over time: This is a two-part question. First, look at the code below and explain the pieces of the data processing pipeline: state.numbers &lt;- accidents %&gt;% purrr:::map_df( .f = function(x) x %&gt;% group_by(STATE) %&gt;% summarize( year= YEAR[1], fatalities = sum(FATALS), accidents = n() ) ) idx &lt;- which(state.numbers$year &lt; 1900) state.numbers$year[idx] &lt;- 1900+state.numbers$year[idx] write.csv(numbers, &quot;data/state-numbers.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE) Second, load the data set state-numbers.csv into your R session and investigate. For interpretation, it will be much easier to change the fips codes to state names. What is the dominant pattern in this plot? How would it be possible to reveal the actual rates of fatalities in each state over time? Try to find a source and investigate how rates of fatalities change for each state over time. 25.6 Solutions getLevels() included above but not shown. Figure 25.14 shows the most common contributing factors.

It measures their readiness to meet life challenges and workforce preparedness. As of 2020, according to the PISA web site more than 90 countries and 3 million students have been involved. Each student, school, parent are also asked to complete extensive questionnaires. Schools provide information about their resources staff qualifications and staffing levels. Parents are asked about the household environment and student support. Students are asked about their interest in different subjects and their friend networks. The data is used by individual countries to inform education policy and improve learning. The news media take this as an opportunity to measure and comment on their country against other countries, and raising the concern about girls and math.

The format of the data by year is different, but in recent years it is provided in proprietary binary formats. The variables collected differ slightly from year to year, although there is a core set of variables that are always included and coded identically. There are multiple files associated with each survey, containing the student questionnaire responses and test scores, school and parent questionnaire responses, two cognitive item responses, and assoociated data dictionaries. In the following analysis we focus on the 2015 student data. It is approximately 580Mb, contains 615 attributes on more than 270,000 students. 28.2 Data pre-processing Read the data directly from the web site. # From http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/ download # the SPSS format zip file `Student questionnaire data file (419MB)&#39; library(haven) pisa_2015 &lt;- read_sav(&quot;https://webfs.oecd.org/pisa/PUF_SAS_COMBINED_CMB_STU_QQQ.zip&quot;) Create a local SQLite database to make it faster to make various summaries and subsets. library(tidyverse) library(dbplyr) library(sqldf) library(DBI) db &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname=&quot;data/PISA.sqlite&quot;) dbWriteTable(conn=db, name=&quot;student&quot;, value=pisa_2015) dbListFields(db, &quot;student&quot;) Use the database to extract a subset of variables. db &lt;- dbConnect(SQLite(), dbname=&quot;data/PISA.sqlite&quot;) tb &lt;- tbl(db, &quot;student&quot;) scores &lt;- tb %&gt;% select(CNT, ST004D01T, PV1MATH, PV1READ, PV1SCIE, SENWT) %&gt;% collect() scores &lt;- scores %&gt;% rename(gender=ST004D01T, math=PV1MATH, reading=PV1READ, science=PV1SCIE, w=SENWT) save(scores, file=&quot;data/pisa_scores.rda&quot;) 28.3 Examining the gender gap across countries The gender gap in math is a common discussion, with the concern being that girls tend to score lower than boys on average in standardized math tests. The PISA data provides an opportunity to explore the gender gap across numerous countries. 28.3.1 Clean up country codes Each country is coded using three letters, which mirror international standard ISO codes, except that a few are unique to this data. In order to join the data, with country names, or map data, these need to be recoded or the records dropped. library(tidyverse) library(ISOcodes) data(&quot;ISO_3166_1&quot;) # Load data load(&quot;data/pisa_scores.rda&quot;) # The country information will be used to jooin the data with map data # and the ISOcodes package provides information about codes and country scores &lt;- scores %&gt;% mutate(CNT=recode(CNT, &quot;QES&quot;=&quot;ESP&quot;, &quot;QCH&quot;=&quot;CHN&quot;, &quot;QAR&quot;=&quot;ARG&quot;, &quot;TAP&quot;=&quot;TWN&quot;)) %&gt;% filter(CNT != &quot;QUC&quot;) %&gt;% filter(CNT != &quot;QUD&quot;) %&gt;% filter(CNT != &quot;QUE&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(gender=factor(gender, levels=c(1,2), labels=c(&quot;female&quot;,&quot;male&quot;))) 28.3.2 Compute weighted means by country and gender Each observation in the student records has an associated survey weight. This reflects the representation of the demographic of the student in comparison to the population demographics. Using the weights to compute a weighted average produces an estimate that better reflects the population mean. The math gap is measured by differencing the boys and girls averages. score_gap &lt;- scores %&gt;% group_by(CNT, gender) %&gt;% summarise(math=weighted.mean(math, w=w, na.rm=T), reading=weighted.mean(reading, w=w, na.rm=T), science=weighted.mean(science, w=w, na.rm=T)) %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols=math:science, names_to=&quot;test&quot;, values_to=&quot;score&quot;) %&gt;% pivot_wider(names_from=gender, values_from=score) %&gt;% mutate(gap = male - female) %&gt;% pivot_wider(id_cols=CNT, names_from=test, values_from=gap) Confidence intervals for the population mean difference can be constructed usng bootstrap.

There are also many countries where there is no significant difference between the gender averages. 28.4 Your turn A problem with the dot plot is that the mean difference axis uses negative numbers, whenever the girls average is higher than the boys. A more accurate reflection on the gender difference would be to use only positive numbers, and label left of 0 to be “girls higher” and right of 0 to be “boys higher”. It could also be useful to have a finer resolution of grid lines on the mean difference. Improve the mean difference axis, so that it has positive numbers only and enhanced labels, and ticks at increments of 5 points. Re-do the analysis using reading scores by gender. Discuss the reading gap across the globe. 28.5 Mapping the scores To generate a map using colour to represent the mean difference, requires joining the data to a map data set. There’s a world map as polygons available in the ggplot2 package, which enables a quick and easy map tp be constructed. The map data needs a few corrections to match the names with the scores data. Colour can be important when representing a numeric variable, so the colour scale is manually constructed. library(ggthemes) world_map &lt;- map_data(&quot;world&quot;) world_map$region[world_map$subregion == &quot;Hong Kong&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Hong Kong&quot; world_map$region[world_map$subregion == &quot;Macao&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Macao&quot; to_map &lt;- left_join(world_map, score_gap, by=c(&quot;region&quot;=&quot;name&quot;)) ggplot(to_map, aes(map_id = region)) + geom_map(aes(fill=math), map = world_map, color=&quot;grey70&quot;, size=0.1) + scale_fill_gradient2(&quot;Math gap&quot;, limits=c(-35, 35), na.value=&quot;grey90&quot;, low=&quot;#1B9E77&quot;, high=&quot;#D95F02&quot;, mid=&quot;white&quot;) + expand_limits(x = world_map$long, y = world_map$lat) + theme_few() + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.key.width=unit(1.5, &quot;cm&quot;), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank()) We learn that there are a few regions where the gender gap is reversed or non-existent. These tend to be Scandinavian countries, south-east Asia and the middle east. 28.6 Your turn Make the world map using reading gap, and summarise your findings. 28.7 Change in scores over time FIXME: Add some learningtower examples.

The data is updated on a monthly basis and available for download from Melbourne Open Data Portal. The rwalkr package provides an API in R to easily access sensor counts and geographic locations.

In light of people’s daily schedules, we plot the counts against time of the day, shown in Figure 30.1.

We further tease out work versus non-work days to explain variations arisen from the discrepancy. Except for Birrarung Marr, the most dominant pattern is driven by the workforce, with commuters’ spikes at 8am and 5pm and a lunch hour rush. These spikes are completely absent on weekends and public holidays. However, non-typical days are yet to be discovered. library(lubridate) library(tsibble) hol2018 &lt;- tsibble::holiday_aus(2018, state = &quot;VIC&quot;) %&gt;% bind_rows(tibble(holiday = &quot;AFL&quot;, date = ymd(&quot;20180929&quot;))) workday &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;Work day&quot;, &quot;Non-work day&quot;)) peds_2018 &lt;- peds_2018 %&gt;% mutate( Day = wday(Date_Time, label = TRUE, week_start = 1), Workday = if_else( (Date %in% hol2018$date) | Day %in% c(&quot;Sat&quot;, &quot;Sun&quot;), workday[2], workday[1]) ) peds_2018 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = Count, group = Date, colour = Sensor)) + geom_line(size = 0.3, alpha = 0.3) + facet_grid(Sensor ~ Workday, labeller = labeller(Sensor = label_wrap_gen(20))) + scale_colour_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;, name = &quot;Sensor&quot;) + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) To locate those unusual moments, Flinders Street Station data is calendarised on the canvas, using the sugrrants package. The calendar plot unfolds the day-to-day life in a fresh way. The White Night event saw the 17th night spike in February. Weeks of the data went missing in the middle of August.

Apart from these temporal factors, the weather condition could possibly affect how many people are walking in the city. In particular, people are likely to stay indoors, when the day is too hot or too cold, or raining hard. Daily meteorological data as a separate source, available on National Climatic Data Center, is used and joined to the main pedestrian data table using common dates. Binary variables are created to serve as the tipping points and avoid multicollinearity issues for modelling later, rather than the original numerics. melb_ghcn &lt;- read_rds(&quot;data/melb_ghcn.rds&quot;) high_prcp_fct &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;none&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;)) high_temp_fct &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;not&quot;, &quot;hot&quot;)) low_temp_fct &lt;- fct_inorder(c(&quot;not&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;)) melb_ghcn &lt;- melb_ghcn %&gt;% mutate( high_prcp = ifelse(prcp &gt; 5, high_prcp_fct[2], high_prcp_fct[1]), high_temp = ifelse(tmax &gt; 33, high_temp_fct[2], high_temp_fct[1]), low_temp = ifelse(tmin &lt; 6, low_temp_fct[2], low_temp_fct[1]) ) peds_weather &lt;- peds_2018 %&gt;% left_join(melb_ghcn, by = c(&quot;Date&quot; = &quot;date&quot;)) We are going to fit a Poisson model on hourly counts, regressed on a three-way interactions between Time, Workday, and Sensor, and three meteorological variables. It is an appropriate choice to fit the Poisson model, since the response takes non-negative integers only. All the variables have a significant effect on counts. The coefficients of the weather variables are all negative, meaning that the higher/lower temperature and raining days tend to have lower counts than the other days. peds_fit &lt;- peds_weather %&gt;% mutate(Time = as_factor(Time)) %&gt;% glm(Count ~ Time * Workday * Sensor + high_prcp + high_temp + low_temp, data = ., family = poisson(link = &quot;log&quot;)) coef(peds_fit)[c(&quot;high_prcp&quot;, &quot;high_temp&quot;, &quot;low_temp&quot;)] high_prcp high_temp low_temp -0.09710226 -0.07382435 -0.03633938 To examine the goodness of fit for the model, we plot the fitted values against the observed values for the Flinders Street Station, laid out on the calendar again. The pink lines indicate the fitted data. The model performs well in general, excepting for a couple of misfits due to the unusual events we spotted earlier. 30.4 If setting up a coffee business Melbourne is world-renowned for its coffee culture. Location matters a lot to small business, particularly coffee shops. An ideal site should provide constant streams of potential customers all week around. To help decide which site we open the coffee shop, Flinders Street Station or Melbourne Central, we run a simulation study using the fitted model given the following assumptions: At Flinders Street Station, the proportion of pedestrians passing by who will buy a coffee is 0.1 between 7-10am, 0.05 between 10-4pm, 0.01 between 4-8pm. At Melbourne Central, the proportion who will buy coffee is 0.08 between 7-10am, 0.06 between 10-4pm, 0.02 between 4-8pm. No purchases at all other times. Each coffee purchase is $4. One attendant costs $100/hour. Two attendants is $150/hour. Three attendants is $200/hour and four attendants is $250/hour. Each attendant can handle 30 customers per hour. If the number is more than the number the staff can handle, customers will walk out without purchasing. The compute_profit() calculates the profit based on one set of simulated data given the date-times and the number of attendants for two locations. compute_profit &lt;- function(date, time, flinders = 1, central = 1) { peds_sim &lt;- peds_weather %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Count)) %&gt;% mutate(.simulated = simulate(peds_fit, seed = 2020)$sim_1) fl_rate &lt;- c(rep(0, 6), rep(0.1, 3), rep(0.05, 6), rep(0.01, 4), rep(0, 5))[time] mc_rate &lt;- c(rep(0, 6), rep(0.08, 3), rep(0.06, 6), rep(0.02, 4), rep(0, 5))[time] peds_sim &lt;- peds_sim %&gt;% filter(Date == date, Time %in% time) fl_count &lt;- peds_sim %&gt;% filter(Sensor == &quot;Flinders Street Station Underpass&quot;) %&gt;% pull(.simulated) mc_count &lt;- peds_sim %&gt;% filter(Sensor == &quot;Melbourne Central&quot;) %&gt;% pull(.simulated) fl_ncustomers &lt;- pmin(round(fl_count * fl_rate, 0), 30 * flinders) mc_ncustomers &lt;- pmin(round(mc_count * mc_rate, 0), 30 * central) fl_profit &lt;- fl_ncustomers * 4 - (100 + 50 * (flinders - 1)) mc_profit &lt;- mc_ncustomers * 4 - (100 + 50 * (central - 1)) tibble(time = time, flinders = fl_profit, central = mc_profit) } With three attendants at Flinders and two attendants at Melbourne Central, earnings and losses are reported for a Thursday on 2018-03-28. compute_profit(&quot;2018-03-28&quot;, 7:19, flinders = 3, central = 2) # A tibble: 13 × 3 time flinders central &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; 1 7 160 -18 2 8 160 90 3 9 160 90 4 10 72 90 5 11 92 90 6 12 160 90 7 13 160 90 8 14 160 90 9 15 160 90 10 16 -76 42 11 17 0 70 12 18 -76 70 13 19 -128 34 30.5 Your turn Modify the compute_profit() to take account of time-variant attendant numbers and generate 10 simulated sets for a possible range of profits.
